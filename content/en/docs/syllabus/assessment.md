### Entrance Tickets

These are ungraded responses to prompts that I will use to kick-off discussions. On days with an 'entrance ticket', you will have jotted a quick response on a notecard before class (and you'll have printed your name on it too). I will collect these at the start of class. Their _completion_ however will count towards your 'academic presence'. 

### In-class exercises

Periodically, we will do some in-class writing where you draw on the most recent assigned readings and lectures. The first few of these will ask you to write a précis of one or more of the readings. Then, we will build from that towards deeper engagement with the readings/lecture.

I will provide a notebook for you to use for in-class exercises and assessment. Sometimes, you will share what you've written with your peers as the starting point for in-class discussion.

I will distribute and collect these notebooks for the relevant class. The completed notebook will be a resource for you to study in order to prepare for the Exit Ticket.

### Essays?

There will be no essays. 

### The Exit Ticket

At the end of the course, as a final exam, you will write an 'exit ticket'. The Exit Ticket will consist of a single question that you respond to; you will make explicit reference to the various readings (which you have already created précis notes for) in order to craft your response.

The second part of the Exit Ticket is where you evaluate your development as a student in this course according to the explicit learning outcomes. You can then suggest to me an overall grade for the course that you think your work warrants, as a result.

If I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive (thus, you have the opportunity to override the percentage breakdowns below).

**When I have disagreed in previous courses** this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to _raise_ the grade: y'all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you've overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - I would explain this to you and grade accordingly.

### Course Assessment Rubric

+ In-class exercises: best 5 of 6. 70%
+ Exit ticket: 20%
+ Academic Presence: 10%

I reserve the right to adjust those percentages to take into account the particular circumstances of the student.
