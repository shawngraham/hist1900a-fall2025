Then join [our HIST3000|CLCV3000 reading group](https://hypothes.is/groups/XMa13mwk/digiarch-fall2025). If you happen to be reading something, and see an existing annotation that interests you, hit the 'reply' button on the annotation to start a conversation! Sometimes, the person to whom you're replying might be a previous year's student, but that's ok; they might enter into conversation with you. Sometimes, it might be a person who isn't a Carleton student but is following along with the course. That's ok too. Be respectful!

[There is a student guide to Hypothes.is behind this link](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/). Read that for the full information how using Hypothesis.
