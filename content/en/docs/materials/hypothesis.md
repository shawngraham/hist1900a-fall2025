## Hypothes.is: A Tool for Collaborative Reading & Annotation 

The first thing I want you to do is to set up an account with the [Hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) tool.

Then join [our HIST1900a reading group](https://hypothes.is/groups/eyW4RXMR/hist1900a-f25). If you happen to be reading something, and see an existing annotation that interests you, hit the 'reply' button on the annotation to start a conversation! Be respectful!

[There is a student guide to Hypothes.is behind this link](https://web.hypothes.is/quick-start-guide-for-students/). Read that for the full information how using Hypothesis.

While logged into our Hypothes.is reading group, I want you to annotate this website with a single annotation that you will tag with either `#weird`, `#wonderful`, or `#worrying`, and explain briefly why. **You do not have to use your real name as a user name** but email me to tell me the username you are using. Remember, annotations are publicly visible to anyone who uses the Hypothes.is service and who joins our reading group. If you forget to be logged into our group when you make an annotation, your annotation is visible to any Hypothes.is user world-wide. 

You are representing the University, so bring your A game, ok?
