At the end of the course, as a final exam, you will write an 'exit ticket'. The Exit Ticket will consist of a single question that you respond to; you will make explicit reference to the various readings (which you have already created pr√©cis notes for) in order to craft your response. I will release that question to you by week 12.

The second part of the Exit Ticket is where you evaluate your development as a student in this course according to the explicit learning outcomes. **Remember** There is no 'right' or 'wrong' to what you write, but there is 'better' and 'worse' when it comes to explaining how your thinking has changed over time and pointing to the various things you've done that support that story. You can then suggest to me an overall grade for the course that you think your work warrants, as a result (per the learning outcomes).

## Grading

If I agree with your assessment, then that is the grade you will receive (thus, you have the opportunity to override the percentage breakdowns below).

**When I have disagreed in previous courses** this has been, 9.5 times out of 10, to _raise_ the grade: y'all are too hard on yourselves. If I have disagreed and felt that you've overstated things - if you were the 0.5 out of 10 - I would explain this to you and grade accordingly.
