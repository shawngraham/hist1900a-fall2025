> How does the human past become _data_? What does it mean to turn the different kinds of traces we have into something that becomes... counted? And how does the act of counting change what gets valued? In this module, aside from setting up your digital work bench, you'll get some experience of turning the world into data, and you will think deeply about what that means.

Each week, you have tasks, readings, and or things to listen to/watch that I would like you to complete. These should be done -or at least attempted- before moving onto the next week.

These modules roughly map onto the sequence of work in an archaeological project.
