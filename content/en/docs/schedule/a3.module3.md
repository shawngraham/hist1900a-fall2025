> In this final module, you will try to find the compelling story and to communicate it, in various ways, to your intended public. To whom does archaeology belong? Does it matter how we tell the story?

Each week, you have tasks, readings, and or things to listen to/watch that I would like you to complete. These should be done -or at least attempted- before moving onto the next week.

These modules roughly map onto the sequence of work in an archaeological project.
