**When Computers Filled The Room**

This module considers how the idea of 'information' as a thing distinct from the _message_ emerged, how information became a measure of entropy and thus something that could be computed. This means we'll have to think about the telephone network(s), business tabulation machines, World War II research into ballistics, codes, and cypers.
