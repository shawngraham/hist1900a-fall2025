> Which comes first, the technology or the need for the technology?

In this module, we'll look at the emergence of digital computing as a cold-war technology and how various networks first emerged and were inter-networked. ARPAnet was not the only contender! We'll look at how various standards emerged and the political and social contexts of their deployment.

The time period explored will roughly correspond with that period of time from the 1950s to the 1980s, more or less overlapping with the Cold War.
