> Watson come here, I need you

This final module teases apart the strands of the foundational technologies that underpin the 20th century revolution in digital communication: the 19th century Victorian internet. We'll look at the emergence of telegraphy and the first realization that electricity could represent sound and messages. To understand all _that_, we have to go further back and consider sempahore and other kinds of signalling technologies. We'll need to consider things like the Jacquard loom and other ways of extending our cognition into physical media... all the way back to cuneiform and the emergence of writing.
