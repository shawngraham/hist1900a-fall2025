The ‘history of the internet’ is more than the history of a particular package of technologies. It’s a story about power, people, culture, and materials. The ‘internet’ isn’t a thing, it’s a place and since time and space are unified, it’s an age. What is an appropriate frame to study the internet, and once we’ve decided on that, what might we see? I’m not sure where this will take us – but wherever we go, the journey will change how you think about the world. My background is in archaeology: this will be a self-consciously archaeological investigation. We'll start in the present and work our way backwards.

How far will we go? All the way to the bottom.

This is lecture-based 0.5 credit course @ Carleton University in the Fall 2025 semester, with Professor Shawn M. Graham.

My goal is less about 'coverage' or providing you The One True History, but to open the door for you to consider the multiple histories and perspectives an inquiry into this broad topic might reveal. 

Ready? You should start with [the syllabus](../first-things-first).
