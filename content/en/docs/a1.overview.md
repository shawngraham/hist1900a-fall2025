Once the excavation is over, what happens to the information created through archaeological research? What about archaeology that does not involve digging? How do archaeologists use digital technologies on site, in the lab, or on the web? This course explores the intersection of digital technologies and computing with archaeology. We will explore the ways theory gets embedded into computation; perhaps there is even a theory of digital archaeology? We will explore how digital technologies allow us to ask questions that would otherwise be impossible to ask. We will also look into the ways that computational creativity in archaeology allow for novel engagements with the past, thus moving us into a digital public archaeology. This is an online asynchronous course and will require you to head out into your neighborhood to make archaeological observations.

An asynchronous 0.5 credit course @ Carleton University in the Fall 2025 semester, with Professor Shawn M. Graham.
