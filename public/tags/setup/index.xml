      <description>I am asking you to make notes about your process, not take notes. There&amp;rsquo;s a difference.&#xA;When we make notes, we are mindfully building a foundation through a process of linking. Jupyterlite is an environment where we can write analytical code and do statistical analysis, as well as make notes. The idea is that you make your observations there in text files (that use the markdown conventions for styling the text) that link to your analysis.</description>

      <description>üëãüèª Hi!&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s do some coding. The interface below accepts python code (it might take a moment to load up; if you can see a &amp;lsquo;play&amp;rsquo; etc it&amp;rsquo;s loaded). Try copying and pasting this:&#xA;text = &amp;#34;Oh yeah, digital archaeology!&amp;#34; print(text) into the gray box at the bottom of the interface below. Then, hit shift+enter while your cursor is in the box:&#xA;Now try this:&#xA;one = 1 two = 2 print(one + two) See how easy that was?</description>
