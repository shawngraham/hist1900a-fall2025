      <description>Entrance Tickets These are ungraded responses to prompts that I will use to kick-off discussions. On days with an &amp;rsquo;entrance ticket&amp;rsquo;, you will have jotted a quick response on a notecard before class (and you&amp;rsquo;ll have printed your name on it too). I will collect these at the start of class. Their completion however will count towards your &amp;lsquo;academic presence&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;In-class exercises Periodically, we will do some in-class writing where you draw on the most recent assigned readings and lectures.</description>

      <description>The Most Important Idea The internet is an emergent thing at the intersection of power, energy, information, materials, and humans. Always: humans. An archaeological perspective on this pays attention to entanglements and flows. And if we apply the appropriate lenses to how we look, we might begin to understand why and how.&#xA;Spend some time with Kate Crawford&amp;rsquo;s Calculating Empires to see what I mean (you&amp;rsquo;ll want to open this in a new browser window; try taking the audio tour, too).</description>

      <description>According to section 2 of FASS Undergraduate Teaching Regulations and Procedures, this course outline constitutes a contract between you the student, and me, the professor. However, the word ‘syllabus’ (aka, the course outline), it seems is based on a misreading of a misprint of the Greek word ‘sittybis’, meaning a table of contents. A table of contents is not a contract. Nevertheless, let us have a contract thus:&#xA;I, Professor Graham, agree to undertake to the best of my abilities, the task of challenging, guiding, and fostering in you, a deeper appreciation, awareness, and understanding for the ideas discussed in this class.</description>
