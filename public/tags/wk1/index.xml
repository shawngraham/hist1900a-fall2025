      <title>Week 1: Making Notes</title>

      <description>I am asking you to make notes about your process, not take notes. There&amp;rsquo;s a difference.&#xA;When we make notes, we are mindfully building a foundation through a process of linking. Jupyterlite is an environment where we can write analytical code and do statistical analysis, as well as make notes. The idea is that you make your observations there in text files (that use the markdown conventions for styling the text) that link to your analysis.</description>

      <description>üëãüèª Hi!&#xA;Let&amp;rsquo;s do some coding. The interface below accepts python code (it might take a moment to load up; if you can see a &amp;lsquo;play&amp;rsquo; etc it&amp;rsquo;s loaded). Try copying and pasting this:&#xA;text = &amp;#34;Oh yeah, digital archaeology!&amp;#34; print(text) into the gray box at the bottom of the interface below. Then, hit shift+enter while your cursor is in the box:&#xA;Now try this:&#xA;one = 1 two = 2 print(one + two) See how easy that was?</description>

      <description>If any of the instructions below are unclear, annotate this page with hypothesis while being logged into our course reading group. If you spot someone asking for help and you can offer advice, respond to the annotation.&#xA;The sequence of steps below might be a bit different by the time you read this; Github often mucks about with its look and feel. Examine the steps first, and if what you encounter is a bit different than this, you should be able to work out the basic actions to take from this walk-through.</description>
