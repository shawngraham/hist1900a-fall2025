      <description>Which comes first, the technology or the need for the technology?&#xA;In this module, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the emergence of digital computing as a cold-war technology and how various networks first emerged and were inter-networked. ARPAnet was not the only contender! We&amp;rsquo;ll look at how various standards emerged and the political and social contexts of their deployment.&#xA;The time period explored will roughly correspond with that period of time from the 1950s to the 1980s, more or less overlapping with the Cold War.</description>
