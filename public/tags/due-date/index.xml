      <description>&lt;p&gt;At the end of the course, as a final exam, you will write an &amp;rsquo;exit ticket&amp;rsquo;. The Exit Ticket will consist of a single question that you respond to; you will make explicit reference to the various readings (which you have already created précis notes for) in order to craft your response. I will release that question to you by week 12.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The second part of the Exit Ticket is where you evaluate your development as a student in this course according to the explicit learning outcomes. &lt;strong&gt;Remember&lt;/strong&gt; There is no &amp;lsquo;right&amp;rsquo; or &amp;lsquo;wrong&amp;rsquo; to what you write, but there is &amp;lsquo;better&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;worse&amp;rsquo; when it comes to explaining how your thinking has changed over time and pointing to the various things you&amp;rsquo;ve done that support that story. You can then suggest to me an overall grade for the course that you think your work warrants, as a result (per the learning outcomes).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
