      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;ve been practicing taking research memos, if you&amp;rsquo;ve been looking at our feedback and thinking about what I or the TAs have said, you are already 9/10s of the way to writing an essay that can critically examine some issue, backed up with meaningful scholarly insight.&#xA;Yes!

Most of you are in first year: Zotero will save many hours of grief and frustration.&#xA;Zotero is software for citation management and for making notes on what your read and annotations on pdfs. If all you ever do is use it to keep track of the metadata - author, title, publisher, etc - for what you read in university then you will be further ahead than many of your peers.</description>
