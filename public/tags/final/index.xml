      <description>At the end of the course, as a final exam, you will write an &amp;rsquo;exit ticket&amp;rsquo;. The Exit Ticket will consist of a single question that you respond to; you will make explicit reference to the various readings (which you have already created pr√©cis notes for) in order to craft your response. I will release that question to you by week 12.&#xA;The second part of the Exit Ticket is where you evaluate your development as a student in this course according to the explicit learning outcomes.</description>
