As such, the précis, in a compact form, forces you to think about both the content and method of a piece of scholarship. This is very useful in developing an historiographical understanding of the work you are reading, of the connections between works. The formula for the précis is based on a few simple sentences: Sentence one gives the following information: name of the author, title of the work, date in parenthesis; an intentionally chosen active verb (argues, asserts, claims, denies, refutes, proves, disproves, explains, etc.); a that clause containing the major claim/idea (thesis) of the work. Sentence two gives an explanation of how the author develops and supports the major claim of the work identified in the first sentence. Sentence three states the author’s apparent purpose, followed by an “in order to” phrase. Formula: In Chapter 1 of One Dimensional Man (1964), Herbert Marcuse argues that [\u0026hellip;]. To build this argument, Marcuse [\u0026hellip;]. Marcuse makes this argument in order to [\u0026hellip;]. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example from Daniel Nemser\u0026rsquo;s Infrastructures of Race: Concentration and Biopolitics in Colonial Mexico (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2017): In Infrastructures of Race (2017), Daniel Nemser argues that colonial Spanish America created modern racialization by spatializing race as an infrastructure of domination and accumulation. To build this argument, Nemser draws on Foucault\u0026rsquo;s biopolitical regime and Lefebvre\u0026rsquo;s production of space and territorializing of domination, and divides his analysis into four chapters that move through the colonial period through a succession of material, spatial practices: congregación (concentration), recogimiento (enclosure), seperación (segregated districts), and colección. Nemser does this in order to reorient the social construction of race away from bodily difference and to material space and domination, as a means of overcoming the naturalization of difference as a thing upon which race is projected. Dr. Black notes that this particular précis uses a lot of scholarly jargon, but \u0026lsquo;jargon\u0026rsquo; is just the specialized vocabularly of a particular field. It might look like \u0026lsquo;jargon\u0026rsquo; in the pejorative sense to you or me, but for his purposes, it makes sense and builds on previous scholarhsip that he has read. Every field has its own specialized terms used to capture important ideas or complicated issues as a disciplinary short-hand. As he notes, \u0026lsquo;\u0026hellip;When you write your own précis, they will likewise build [on] of your previous knowledge.\u0026rsquo; The Memo Part When we take notes as academics on scholarly literature, we are building up atomic units of thought, little atoms of ideas that can be recombined to make more substantial structures. Or you can think of them as lego bricks where these atomic units are little pieces that eventually you combine together to make something larger. Notice that your observation - your précis - is NOT copying out an idea or the verbatim words of the original author. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s an act of thinking and contextualizing. THEN you expand it into what Black calls a \u0026lsquo;research memo\u0026rsquo;: Following the introductory paragraph (ie, the précis), a research memo should highlight what you found significant in the reading. Identify a question or theme raised in class that the reading helps to answer or addresses. Then explain why you think this reading matters? How does it connect to the other readings of the week or previous weeks? How does it connect with work you\u0026rsquo;re reading outside of class assignments, etc? Two paragraphs. 500 words tops. You need to keep your research memos succinct and on-point. Practice writing these. But not all scholarship follows IMRAD \u0026lsquo;IMRAD\u0026rsquo; stands for \u0026lsquo;Introduction\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Methods\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Results\u0026rsquo;, And, \u0026lsquo;Discussion\u0026rsquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s a very conventional framework used in a lot of social science or scientific writing, and my comments above are largely developed with that kind of literature in mind. But it\u0026rsquo;s not universal.

Yes! It\u0026rsquo;s true! Note Making IS Writing The secret to academic writing is that your notes have already done a lot of the thinking for you. An essay is simply the process of arranging these atomic thoughts in a sensible order and then filling in the gaps. An \u0026rsquo;essay\u0026rsquo; - literally, \u0026lsquo;something you try\u0026rsquo; where you explain a concept to yourself or someone else - is a pedagogical exercise for your mind. Right now, for you, the point of an essay is the doing of it, not the byproduct-of-it-having-been-done (ie, a stack of paper that someone else might read). And frankly, until you\u0026rsquo;ve had more experience in dialogue with scholarly literature, digesting it, making sense of it, I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;re ready for an essay. What\u0026rsquo;s more, the instrumentalization of higher education means that for too many people, such things are regarded as hurdles to jump in order to get a grade. A grade then translates into a better chance at a job. In which case, a rationale response is in fact to use some kind of machine to generate an essay to jump over the hurdle, right? So I haven\u0026rsquo;t assigned you an essay because the pedagogical value of that kind of exercise, right now, at this stage in your scholarly development, would get lost in the noise of instrumentalization. This is why we\u0026rsquo;re going with an Exit Ticket instead. But, here\u0026rsquo;s how we\u0026rsquo;d do an essay if we were I\u0026rsquo;d have all of my research memos in something like Obsidian that allows me to create links between ideas. (If you want to see what that\u0026rsquo;s like, you can try a webapp I build called PKM WebNotes). I\u0026rsquo;d read through my notes and search for connections. I would make those connections using Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s wiki-linking ability (we\u0026rsquo;ll actually practice this kind of thing in class). I\u0026rsquo;d examine the resulting visualization of connected ideas to see what thoughts might emerge from my research memos I\u0026rsquo;d look for pathways in my notes between interesting ideas I\u0026rsquo;d arrange each research memo in sequence along those paths I\u0026rsquo;d write the connecting tissue, the literary flourishes, that explain the connections. So why not give that a try for your next class? I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of value in the discipline that crafting an essay requires. And if you\u0026rsquo;ve learned to make research memos, you will never be at a loss for what to write. The last minute panic of a deadline won\u0026rsquo;t happen, because you\u0026rsquo;ve already done all your thinking as a habit, as part of your scholarly reading apparatus. Make your own luck That is my hope, my goal, for you. Look, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this scholar-schtick for almost thirty years now. I do it because I get a buzz out of making the connections, finding the why, the how, and the meaning, behind the things I see in the world. If you can do that too, you\u0026rsquo;ll never have to rely on luck or tricks to get the job etc: you make your own luck by making yourself ready for it.

You don\u0026rsquo;t start at the beginning and wait for the big reveal at the end. (You don\u0026rsquo;t write like that either.) Read Like A Predator Read like a predator. You\u0026rsquo;re after something. Each time your read the paper, you\u0026rsquo;re after something different. First time: just the abstract, maybe the intro Second time: intro, conclusion Third time: discussion, conclusion Fourth time: methods What you\u0026rsquo;re doing is a kind of triage. You don\u0026rsquo;t need AI to \u0026lsquo;summarize\u0026rsquo; a paper because a) ChatGPT just shortens it, which means nuance and important materials get dropped because it was trained on things that looked like summaries, not things that were summaries b) the flippin\u0026rsquo; author has already summarized it for you. This is what the abstract does. When we do research, we find far more than we can ever read. So we read the abstracts first to decide what to put our energy into. That\u0026rsquo;s the first step in deciding what is useful, what to read, what to give care and energy to. Process Is The Point How I do things is not the only way; you will eventually develop your own style. But seeing as how this is a first year class, I want you to do it my way for now, so that you have a good basis for developing your own emerging style. The key thing is that we\u0026rsquo;re focussed on your process rather than on product. This is exercise for the mind. Once you have a body of material that you intend to read more carefully, we\u0026rsquo;re on to step 2. Now you read the introduction and then jump straight to the conclusion. The introduction expands on the promise of the abstract and gives you more background on the big ticket issues the paper addresses. The conclusion functions as a kind of summary of the findings: how do these stack up against what was signalled in the intro? Again, this is triage. Having looked at the abstract, intro, and conclusion (making notes all the way, more on that in a bit), you might decide that these papers require deeper investigation, and those papers can be set aside for now. At this point, you do your third reading by diving into the \u0026lsquo;discussion\u0026rsquo; section. This is the meat of a paper; it\u0026rsquo;s where all of the caveats and interesting findings get pulled apart, contextualized, and explored. Re-reading the conclusion in the light of the discussion will clarify for you the importance of the findings and allow you to think about them in the context of other things you\u0026rsquo;ve read. Finally, you might find that this paper, this one right here is so meaningful for you, you\u0026rsquo;ll read it a fourth time and dive deeply into its methods. Annotating Scholarly Work As you read, you annotate the work. Academic \u0026lsquo;reading\u0026rsquo; is not a passive activity where your eyes slide over the page! And I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about highlighting things, either. Academic reading counts as writing (because we write in order to understand what we think: \u0026lsquo;writing\u0026rsquo; means, \u0026lsquo;making sense of\u0026rsquo;.) You need a system for marking up the text, for making sense of it. For the purposes of this course, I want you to use the Hypothes.is web app to mark up texts while being logged into our reading group. Your annotations will be visible to the rest of the class. Reading is a social activity. I will suggest the following tags should be used: #important // for an important finding as a result of the research #question // a question that YOU have upon reading this piece of text #idea // an important or interesting idea raised by the author. Why is it important/interesting? #connection // where you make a direct connection to something else you\u0026#39;ve read. #quote // a very pithy phrase that beautifully captures the idea As you mark up the text, use these tags to categorize your observation. You can assign more than one tag to an annotation. Since every annotation has its own permalink, you can even provide a direct link to another observation as part of your annotation. Since this is a social reading experience, pay attention to the parts no one else touches. Ask yourself, \u0026lsquo;why is no one touching this part?\u0026rsquo; That\u0026rsquo;s often because there are complicated ideas there that others are afraid to explore. (nb Sometimes, Hypothes.is won\u0026rsquo;t work on a page; these are usually pages with a lot of layers of user interface on them. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to avoid giving you such things, but if you come across a page where Hypothes.is won\u0026rsquo;t work, you can make notes on a piece of paper etc.) Then what? Periodically, in class, I will ask you to make a précis/research memo based on one of the assigned readings, from memory. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to make a précis/research memo.

Allow me to introduce a useful approach to reading such material by Danna Agmon called \u0026lsquo;THOMAS\u0026rsquo;. I quote Agmon directly below: THOMAS: A Useful Mnemonic for Reading Historical Scholarship When reading works of historical scholarship, the following mnemonic is a helpful tool to keep in mind as you prepare for class. All the questions are key for understanding the book, but they are arranged in ascending order of importance, from least to most important. Topic: The basic questions: When? Where? What is this book/article about? Historiography: What are the multiple scholarly conversations in which this work participates? What does it add to these conversations? Organization: what is the central organizing structure of this work? Chronological? Thematic? Geographic? Are there any narrative devices put to use? How does the organization advance the argument? Method: What sources are used in this book? How is this evidence analyzed? Is there an overarching theoretical or conceptual approach? How does the theory intersect with the evidence? Argument: What is this author’s original thesis? What new thing does it explain? So what? This could be rephrased as \u0026ldquo;significance\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;stakes.\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot; What is important or useful about this book, beyond the confines of the topic? Put differently, why would non-specialists in the field care to read this book? If you were writing a research method using the THOMAS mnemonic, just write the headings down the left hand side of the page, then scribble out some boxes: Write the \u0026lsquo;citation key\u0026rsquo; for whatever you\u0026rsquo;re reading across the top, and a short version of the title, eg Graham2006 Networks \u0026amp; Roman Itineraries \u0026amp; ABM. A \u0026lsquo;citation key\u0026rsquo; is a short code that you use to refer to scholarly works without having to go through the full bother of writing out the bibliography. Zotero and other reference managers use these to provide a unique identifier to a scholarly work. Then, proceed to fill in the grid. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use the grid, of course; a series of headings works just as well. Point-form is fine HOWEVER you have to provide enough detail so that Future You who returns to these notes a week, a month, a term later has some idea of what you are talking about. Similarly, if/when I ask you to do one of these in class from memory, you\u0026rsquo;ve got to provide enough so that I understand what you\u0026rsquo;re talking about. Then, at bottom, just like with the other approach (the précis), you\u0026rsquo;d contextualize more broadly: \u0026hellip;[you] should highlight what you found significant in the reading. Identify a question or theme raised in class that the reading helps to answer or addresses. Then explain why you think this reading matters? How does it connect to the other readings of the week or previous weeks? How does it connect with work you\u0026rsquo;re reading outside of class assignments, etc?

Most of you are in first year: Zotero will save many hours of grief and frustration. Zotero is software for citation management and for making notes on what your read and annotations on pdfs. If all you ever do is use it to keep track of the metadata - author, title, publisher, etc - for what you read in university then you will be further ahead than many of your peers. I am not going to police your usage of Zotero (or require some kind of assessment piece on using it) but I strongly recommend you take the time to learn how to use it. You can download and install Zotero from https://www.zotero.org/. Then, if you make an account with Zotero as well you can take advantage of some free storage space that allows you to sync your notes and library across multiple devices. So how do you use it? Our friends at the University of Ottawa have a very helpful video; MacOdrum Library provides this walk-through pdf. How do I use it? If I\u0026rsquo;m looking up articles on (eg) JSTOR and I have Zotero installed (along with its plugins for my web browser), I can just click a button in my browser to get Zotero to harvest all of the metadata (including, often, the full article pdf!) for the article I\u0026rsquo;m reading. When I come to write something, and I want to create my bibliography, I can set Zotero to MLA style (or Harvard, or whatever) and then drag-and-drop the reference into Word; because I\u0026rsquo;m dragging from Zotero, the citation will be fully formatted in the proper style. That\u0026rsquo;s an absolute minimum use case. If that\u0026rsquo;s all you ever did with Zotero, that would still put you ahead of most of your peers.

COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses. PLAGIARISM The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include: reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source; submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; using another’s data or research findings; failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; handing in \u0026ldquo;substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs.\u0026rdquo; Plagiarism is a serious offence which cannot be resolved directly with the course’s instructor. The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; for the course.

This is used when there is an allegation of an academic offence. The notation is replaced with the appropriate grade for the course as soon as it is available. IP In Progress – a notation (IP) assigned to a course by a faculty member when: At the undergraduate level, an undergraduate thesis or course has not been completed by the end of the period of registration. WDN Withdrawn. No academic credit, no impact on the CGPA. WDN is a permanent notation that appears on the official transcript for students who withdraw after the full fee adjustment date in each term (noted in the Academic Year section of the Calendar each term). Students may withdraw on or before the last day of classes. Standing in a course is determined by the course instructor subject to the approval of the Faculty Dean. This means that grades submitted by the instructor may be subject to revision. No grades are final until they have been approved by the Dean. WITHDRAWAL WITHOUT ACADEMIC PENALTY September 30, 2025: Last day for a full fee adjustment when withdrawing from full fall and fall/winter (full year) courses (financial withdrawal). November 15, 2025: Last day for academic withdrawal. REQUESTS FOR ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS You may need special arrangements to meet your academic obligations during the term.

information, materials, and humans. Always: humans. An archaeological perspective on this pays attention to entanglements and flows. And if we apply the appropriate lenses to how we look, we might begin to understand why and how. Spend some time with Kate Crawford\u0026rsquo;s Calculating Empires to see what I mean (you\u0026rsquo;ll want to open this in a new browser window; try taking the audio tour, too). My Philosophy of Learning As a general philosophy of learning, I do not aim for \u0026lsquo;coverage\u0026rsquo; of a topic. Rather, by exploring a topic as a series of connected stories or lenses I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your own research goals. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to give you frameworks and practice for deep reflective thinking. You might have expectations about what \u0026lsquo;university writing\u0026rsquo; looks like and you are trying very hard to fit those expectations. That gets things exactly backwards. Scholarly writing is what we do to figure out what we think. I therefore am trying to give you practice in getting set up for that moment. It\u0026rsquo;s about unpacking the game and the way scholarly thinking works. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. After all, to mix sporting metaphors, you’re here for ice-time, not the Stanley Cup. You have to do the work, right? Learning is an active thing. This is a course aimed at the first year student, newly arrived at Carleton. To be honest, such a person has not yet learned how to be a university student. All of the assessment therefore is geared towards creating the foundational habits-of-thought upon which you can build a successful learning experience. It\u0026rsquo;s weight training for your mind. So\u0026hellip; no essays. But I guarantee you: you\u0026rsquo;ll write better essays elsewhere after this class. Text/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software. Class format This class happens on Mondays and Wednesdays, 11.35 am - 12.55 pm, in LA C264. AI All of the assessment happens in-class, by hand. This is because you do not have the scholarly background yet to deal with AI yet. If you went to a gym, and there was a machine that lifted weights up and down for you, could you say that you\u0026rsquo;ve had a work-out, if the machine moved the weights around? Because isn\u0026rsquo;t that the point of a gym: moving weights from A to B? So a machine would be more efficient, and better at it? \u0026hellip;Right? That sound you hear is of a point being missed. The correct answer is, \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo;. The correct answer is, we lift the weights so that our muscles undergo the process of strengthening, conditioning, developing. In the same way, the use of any generative AI system to create written work in a class is a pointless stupid thing to do. In the same way having a machine lift weights for you misses the point, so too does having a machine generate a \u0026lsquo;paper\u0026rsquo;. (Which incidentally will be just formed from statistical chains of plausible bullshit.) You\u0026rsquo;re in university to develop your mind, not to have a stack of papers on your desk. Process Is The Point You lift weights so that your body undergoes the process. The process is the point. You write to train your mind to think, to put your mind through a process. The point was never to have x number of things-written. Yet, many people seem to treat university as the accumulation of papers in exchange for a piece of paper. That is profoundly sad. But because AI is, at heart, a web technology, we will be looking at it and exploring some parts of it so that you can properly situate it in its broader context (and if you want to get a headstart at that, try \u0026lsquo;Models All The Way Down\u0026rsquo;. THAT WILL BE THE ONLY TIME where it will be ok to work with generative AI in this course. Lift the weights for yourself. Anything else is\u0026hellip; point-less. Null points. 0.

Meaning depends on context. Nothing exists on its own. In the process of becoming, we respond to the materials we work with, and they respond to us. Therefore, networks (of all kinds) are fundamental to how we live in the world. A network is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows. Network shapes and flow give rise to emergent structures. Networks also are a mechanism through which computation can happen. Networks are the substrate of social life, and networks exist in the physical world and leave traces. Digital media extend our cognition into and through electrical and magnetic relationships. The components of a networked history are an assemblage (which in this context means \u0026lsquo;a coming together\u0026rsquo;). The \u0026lsquo;internet\u0026rsquo; is just a handy phrase to describe an emergent structure of many networks of many kinds. What is the history of the internet understood this way? It\u0026rsquo;s more than a simple sequence of x was invented in 1934; y was invented in 1955, I know that much. This course is a formalized exploration of these questions and ideas; I do not know the answers! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you. Outcomes By the end of this class, you ought to be able to Situate the emergence and evolution of the Internet in the historiography of digital technology more generally Assess relevant scholarly literature for key themes and findings Organize research and begin to implement personal knowledge management techniques for your scholarly reading and note making Texts See the Course Work Overview section. All readings are open access or available through the MacOdrum Library Website (you might have to be logged into Carleton\u0026rsquo;s systems/website). Do the reading before the class in question. When Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know: Trust. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something is up. I trust you. When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to. Just put \u0026ldquo;something has come up\u0026rdquo; in the subject line. COVID IS STILL A THING \u0026lsquo;Oh it\u0026rsquo;s just a really bad cold\u0026rsquo;. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not. But politically, that\u0026rsquo;s the story we tell. I fully expect that at some point during the term, COVID and its complications will happen to some of you. When this happens (whether or not it\u0026rsquo;s formally diagnosed), just email me and say that \u0026ldquo;something has come up\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t require a dr\u0026rsquo;s note, or any of the details. Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t. Again, I trust you, and we\u0026rsquo;ll figure something else out. (But if you do come to class, do wear a mask. It makes a difference.) Similarly, I have people in my life who are at risk.

It’s a story about power, people, culture, and materials. The ‘internet’ isn’t a thing, it’s a place and since time and space are unified, it’s an age. What is an appropriate frame to study the internet, and once we’ve decided on that, what might we see? I’m not sure where this will take us – but wherever we go, the journey will change how you think about the world. My background is in archaeology: this will be a self-consciously archaeological investigation. We\u0026rsquo;ll start in the present and work our way backwards. How far will we go? All the way to the bottom. This is lecture-based 0.5 credit course @ Carleton University in the Fall 2025 semester, with Professor Shawn M. Graham. My goal is less about \u0026lsquo;coverage\u0026rsquo; or providing you The One True History, but to open the door for you to consider the multiple histories and perspectives an inquiry into this broad topic might reveal.
