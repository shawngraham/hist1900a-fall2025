As such, the précis, in a compact form, forces you to think about both the content and method of a piece of scholarship. This is very useful in developing an historiographical understanding of the work you are reading, of the connections between works. The formula for the précis is based on a few simple sentences: Sentence one gives the following information: name of the author, title of the work, date in parenthesis; an intentionally chosen active verb (argues, asserts, claims, denies, refutes, proves, disproves, explains, etc.); a that clause containing the major claim/idea (thesis) of the work. Sentence two gives an explanation of how the author develops and supports the major claim of the work identified in the first sentence. Sentence three states the author’s apparent purpose, followed by an “in order to” phrase. Formula: In Chapter 1 of One Dimensional Man (1964), Herbert Marcuse argues that [\u0026hellip;]. To build this argument, Marcuse [\u0026hellip;]. Marcuse makes this argument in order to [\u0026hellip;]. Here\u0026rsquo;s an example from Daniel Nemser\u0026rsquo;s Infrastructures of Race: Concentration and Biopolitics in Colonial Mexico (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2017): In Infrastructures of Race (2017), Daniel Nemser argues that colonial Spanish America created modern racialization by spatializing race as an infrastructure of domination and accumulation. To build this argument, Nemser draws on Foucault\u0026rsquo;s biopolitical regime and Lefebvre\u0026rsquo;s production of space and territorializing of domination, and divides his analysis into four chapters that move through the colonial period through a succession of material, spatial practices: congregación (concentration), recogimiento (enclosure), seperación (segregated districts), and colección. Nemser does this in order to reorient the social construction of race away from bodily difference and to material space and domination, as a means of overcoming the naturalization of difference as a thing upon which race is projected. Dr. Black notes that this particular précis uses a lot of scholarly jargon, but \u0026lsquo;jargon\u0026rsquo; is just the specialized vocabularly of a particular field. It might look like \u0026lsquo;jargon\u0026rsquo; in the pejorative sense to you or me, but for his purposes, it makes sense and builds on previous scholarhsip that he has read. Every field has its own specialized terms used to capture important ideas or complicated issues as a disciplinary short-hand. As he notes, \u0026lsquo;\u0026hellip;When you write your own précis, they will likewise build [on] of your previous knowledge.\u0026rsquo; When we take notes as academics on scholarly literature, we are building up atomic units of thought, little atoms of ideas that can be recombined to make more substantial structures. Or you can think of them as lego bricks where these atomic units are little pieces that eventually you combine together to make something larger. Notice that your observation - your précis - is NOT copying out an idea or the verbatim words of the original author. Rather, it\u0026rsquo;s an act of thinking and contextualizing. THEN you expand it into what Black calls a \u0026lsquo;research memo\u0026rsquo;: Following the introductory paragraph (ie, the précis), a research memo should highlight what you found significant in the reading. Identify a question or theme raised in class that the reading helps to answer or addresses. Then explain why you think this reading matters? How does it connect to the other readings of the week or previous weeks? How does it connect with work you\u0026rsquo;re reading outside of class assignments, etc? Two paragraphs. 500 words tops. You need to keep your research memos succinct and on-point. Practice writing these. But not all scholarship follows IMRAD \u0026lsquo;IMRAD\u0026rsquo; stands for \u0026lsquo;Introduction\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Methods\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Results\u0026rsquo;, And, \u0026lsquo;Discussion\u0026rsquo;. That\u0026rsquo;s a very conventional framework used in a lot of social science or scientific writing, and my comments above were largely developed with that kind of literature in mind. But it\u0026rsquo;s not universal.

Yes! It\u0026rsquo;s true! Note Making IS Writing The secret to academic writing is that your notes have already done a lot of the thinking for you. An essay is simply the process of arranging these atomic thoughts in a sensible order and then filling in the gaps. An \u0026rsquo;essay\u0026rsquo; - literally, \u0026lsquo;something you try\u0026rsquo; where you explain a concept to yourself or someone else - is a pedagogical exercise for your mind. Right now, for you, the point of an essay is the doing of it, not the byproduct-of-it-having-been-done (ie, a stack of paper that someone else might read). And frankly, until you\u0026rsquo;ve had more experience in dialogue with scholarly literature, digesting it, making sense of it, I don\u0026rsquo;t think you\u0026rsquo;re ready for an essay. What\u0026rsquo;s more, the instrumentalization of higher education means that for too many people, such things are regarded as hurdles to jump in order to get a grade. A grade then translates into a better chance at a job. In which case, a rationale response is in fact to use some kind of machine to generate an essay to jump over the hurdle, right? So I haven\u0026rsquo;t assigned you an essay because the pedagogical value of that kind of exercise, right now, at this stage in your scholarly development, would get lost in the noise of instrumentalization. This is why we\u0026rsquo;re going with an Exit Ticket instead. But, here\u0026rsquo;s how we\u0026rsquo;d do an essay if we were I\u0026rsquo;d have all of my research memos in something like Obsidian that allows me to create links between ideas. (If you want to see what that\u0026rsquo;s like, you can try a webapp I build called PKM WebNotes). I\u0026rsquo;d read through my notes and search for connections. I would make those connections using Obsidian\u0026rsquo;s wiki-linking ability (we\u0026rsquo;ll actually practice this kind of thing in class). I\u0026rsquo;d examine the resulting visualization of connected ideas to see what thoughts might emerge from my research memos I\u0026rsquo;d look for pathways in my notes between interesting ideas I\u0026rsquo;d arrange each research memo in sequence along those paths I\u0026rsquo;d write the connecting tissue, the literary flourishes, that explain the connections. So why not give that a try for your next class? I think there\u0026rsquo;s a lot of value in the discipline that crafting an essay requires. And if you\u0026rsquo;ve learned to make research memos, you will never be at a loss for what to write. The last minute panic of a deadline won\u0026rsquo;t happen, because you\u0026rsquo;ve already done all your thinking as a habit, as part of your scholarly reading apparatus. Make your own luck That is my hope, my goal, for you. Look, I\u0026rsquo;ve been doing this scholar-schtick for almost thirty years now. I do it because I get a buzz out of making the connections, finding the why, the how, and the meaning, behind the things I see in the world. If you can do that too, you\u0026rsquo;ll never have to rely on luck or tricks to get the job etc: you make your own luck by making yourself ready for it.

You don\u0026rsquo;t start at the beginning and wait for the big reveal at the end. (You don\u0026rsquo;t write like that either.) Read Like A Predator Read like a predator. You\u0026rsquo;re after something. Each time your read the paper, you\u0026rsquo;re after something different. First time: just the abstract, maybe the intro Second time: intro, conclusion Third time: discussion, conclusion Fourth time: methods What you\u0026rsquo;re doing is a kind of triage. You don\u0026rsquo;t need AI to \u0026lsquo;summarize\u0026rsquo; a paper because a) ChatGPT just shortens it, which means nuance and important materials get dropped because it was trained on things that looked like summaries, not things that were summaries b) the flippin\u0026rsquo; author has already summarized it for you. This is what the abstract does. When we do research, we find far more than we can ever read. So we read the abstracts first to decide what to put our energy into. That\u0026rsquo;s the first step in deciding what is useful, what to read, what to give care and energy to. Process Is The Point How I do things is not the only way; you will eventually develop your own style. But seeing as how this is a first year class, I want you to do it my way for now, so that you have a good basis for developing your own emerging style. The key thing is that we\u0026rsquo;re focussed on your process rather than on product. This is exercise for the mind. Once you have a body of material that you intend to read more carefully, we\u0026rsquo;re on to step 2. Now you read the introduction and then jump straight to the conclusion. The introduction expands on the promise of the abstract and gives you more background on the big ticket issues the paper addresses. The conclusion functions as a kind of summary of the findings: how do these stack up against what was signalled in the intro? Again, this is triage. Having looked at the abstract, intro, and conclusion (making notes all the way, more on that in a bit), you might decide that these papers require deeper investigation, and those papers can be set aside for now. At this point, you do your third reading by diving into the \u0026lsquo;discussion\u0026rsquo; section. This is the meat of a paper; it\u0026rsquo;s where all of the caveats and interesting findings get pulled apart, contextualized, and explored. Re-reading the conclusion in the light of the discussion will clarify for you the importance of the findings and allow you to think about them in the context of other things you\u0026rsquo;ve read. Finally, you might find that this paper, this one right here is so meaningful for you, you\u0026rsquo;ll read it a fourth time and dive deeply into its methods. Annotating Scholarly Work As you read, you annotate the work. Academic \u0026lsquo;reading\u0026rsquo; is not a passive activity where your eyes slide over the page! And I\u0026rsquo;m not talking about highlighting things, either. Academic reading counts as writing (because we write in order to understand what we think: \u0026lsquo;writing\u0026rsquo; means, \u0026lsquo;making sense of\u0026rsquo;.) You need a system for marking up the text, for making sense of it. For the purposes of this course, I want you to use the Hypothes.is web app to mark up texts while being logged into our reading group. Your annotations will be visible to the rest of the class. Reading is a social activity. I will suggest the following tags should be used: #important // for an important finding as a result of the research #question // a question that YOU have upon reading this piece of text #idea // an important or interesting idea raised by the author. Why is it important/interesting? #connection // where you make a direct connection to something else you\u0026#39;ve read. #quote // a very pithy phrase that beautifully captures the idea As you mark up the text, use these tags to categorize your observation. You can assign more than one tag to an annotation. Since every annotation has its own permalink, you can even provide a direct link to another observation as part of your annotation. Since this is a social reading experience, pay attention to the parts no one else touches. Ask yourself, \u0026lsquo;why is no one touching this part?\u0026rsquo; That\u0026rsquo;s often because there are complicated ideas there that others are afraid to explore. (nb Sometimes, Hypothes.is won\u0026rsquo;t work on a page; these are usually pages with a lot of layers of user interface on them. I\u0026rsquo;ll try to avoid giving you such things, but if you come across a page where Hypothes.is won\u0026rsquo;t work, you can make notes on a piece of paper etc.) Then what? Periodically, in class, I will ask you to make a précis/research memo based on one of the assigned readings, from memory. Here\u0026rsquo;s how to make a précis/research memo.

I quote Agmon directly below: THOMAS: A Useful Mnemonic for Reading Historical Scholarship When reading works of historical scholarship, the following mnemonic is a helpful tool to keep in mind as you prepare for class. All the questions are key for understanding the book, but they are arranged in ascending order of importance, from least to most important. Topic: The basic questions: When? Where? What is this book/article about? Historiography: What are the multiple scholarly conversations in which this work participates? What does it add to these conversations? Organization: what is the central organizing structure of this work? Chronological? Thematic? Geographic? Are there any narrative devices put to use? How does the organization advance the argument? Method: What sources are used in this book? How is this evidence analyzed? Is there an overarching theoretical or conceptual approach? How does the theory intersect with the evidence? Argument: What is this author’s original thesis? What new thing does it explain? So what? This could be rephrased as \u0026ldquo;significance\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;stakes.\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot; What is important or useful about this book, beyond the confines of the topic? Put differently, why would non-specialists in the field care to read this book? If you were writing a research method using the THOMAS mnemonic, just write the headings down the left hand side of the page, then scribble out some boxes: Write the \u0026lsquo;citation key\u0026rsquo; for whatever you\u0026rsquo;re reading across the top, and a short version of the title, eg Graham2006 Networks \u0026amp; Roman Itineraries \u0026amp; ABM. A \u0026lsquo;citation key\u0026rsquo; is a short code that you use to refer to scholarly works without having to go through the full bother of writing out the bibliography. Zotero and other reference managers use these to provide a unique identifier to a scholarly work. Then, proceed to fill in the grid. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to use the grid, of course; a series of headings works just as well.

Content? JupyterLab? What? There are two interconnected components to this course. This website: it is the overarching context for what I am trying to teach you re digital archaeology. It specifies what to read and listen and do each week. Most of the time, when I want you to do something, it will be at your workbench. The workbench. The workbench is made of two things: a. JupyterLab Desktop: this is an application that you download and install. When you first run it, if you\u0026rsquo;ve never done any kind of coding work, it will ask you if you want to install the bundled Python. You say \u0026lsquo;yes\u0026rsquo;. This platform lets us do a variety of computational approaches to archaeology. b. The content: this is a folder of markdown text files and \u0026lsquo;jupyter notebook\u0026rsquo; files that together help you do the exercises I want you to try. A markdown text file is signalled by the file extension .md (just like a word document is signalled by the file extension .doc and a pdf by .pdf). A file that ends in .ipynb is a special kind of text file that JupyterLab Desktop recognizes as combining text and code. JupyterLab Desktop enables us to run the code and manipulate the results. I sometimes call these \u0026lsquo;computational notes\u0026rsquo; or \u0026rsquo;notebooks\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;jupyter files\u0026rsquo;. Instructions on how to install all of this is here. See also week 1 A special feature of the JupyterLab Desktop is a custom extension I built for it that turns it into a note-making application. Thus, I want you to make new markdown files inside the content folder I give you where you keep notes on your observations and experiments, thoughts and readings. These notes can be interlinked with other notes or the computational jupyter notebooks. You end up with a personal wiki style record of your thought and work. There is a cognitive benefit to actively making notes and making them join up in meaningful ways. You can make your weekly logs in the workbench. You can drag and drop individual files to your repository on github.com. You can also export notes from your workbench as .doc files if you feel the need to make things more pretty. When do I submit weekly ungraded work for feedback? By the end of the relevant week. Fridays preferably, but anytime during the week is fine. I will always send out to everyone a summary the following week of things I\u0026rsquo;m seeing (good things, things that need work). I\u0026rsquo;ll follow up with a short note to individuals for individual things. Where do I submit the links to my materials (both ungraded and graded)? Add your materials to your online Github repository. Commit the changes. Take note of the URL. Then, look at the bottom of every Weekly Work page. There\u0026rsquo;s a link to a google form. Fill in the form; give me the URL to your materials. But for the avoidance of doubt: this is the form Information about setting up your github account and using it is here Make sure that you respond to the prompts for reflection. When and where do I submit the consolidation documents (ie, materials for grading)? Every fourth week: Module 1 consolidation document: due by the end of day FRIDAY of week four. OCTOBER 3 Module 2 consolidation document: due by the end of day FRIDAY of week eight. NOVEMBER 7 Module 3 consolidation document: due by the end of day FRIDAY of week twelve. DECEMBER 5 Use the google link at the end of the relevant week\u0026rsquo;s page to give the url to your repository containing your consolidation document. But again, for the avoidance of doubt: this is the form How formal should the ungraded work be? These are more working documents and memos to your future self. That said, they should be clearly intelligible. Also, anything that you produce in the course of trying one of the exercise is the kind of thing that is useful for your future self, so put it all in the repository. How formal should my consolidation document be? I expect the same level of formality and professionalism appropriate to any third year university course. Writing is thinking; writing is the work. You want us to do all of this stuff?! Short answer: No Long answer: I want you to push yourself until you get stuck. And then I want you to tell me about it. I want you to talk with other people in the class. I want you to find solutions, but I also want you to be comfortable in not necessarily finding them right now. This class is about habits of mind, not correct answers. Ok? The focus is always on process. Do not aim for \u0026lsquo;completion\u0026rsquo; ie \u0026lsquo;I did all the exercises I deserve an A\u0026rsquo;. Drive for understanding. One exercise where you understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on and you could use as a foundation for doing something new is far more valuable than clicking through all of the code cells in a computational notebook so that it can be \u0026lsquo;done\u0026rsquo;, without understanding why or what\u0026rsquo;s going on. (Look, this paragraph has all sorts of emphatic markers in it: pay attention!) Let\u0026rsquo;s say there are 40 hours in the week. You\u0026rsquo;re a full-time university student, with 5 courses. That\u0026rsquo;s 5 x 3hrs of lecture per week: 15 hours expected to be in class. That leaves 25 hours for non-classroom work (research, reading, exercises). 25 / 5 = 5 hours per week per class. Therefore: spend 3 hours per week reading / listening to / exploring the course materials spend 5 hours per week doing the exercises = 1 day of the week, just for this course. Push until you get stuck. Report, reflect, move on. If you complete everything I set for you, great: you didn\u0026rsquo;t get stuck so I expect to see in your log that you went out and pursued an idea further. If the first thing I asked you to do utterly flummoxed you, great: you got stuck so I expect to see in your log evidence for your thinking around why you got stuck, things you might come back to, implications for your own learning. Process is more important than product. This isn\u0026rsquo;t about completing every side-quest. That\u0026rsquo;s not what education is about. You can pick your battles in terms of most of the things I ask you to do. What\u0026rsquo;s a good way to ask for permission to visit a graveyard? Write, or use this to develop a script if speaking to a person: \u0026ldquo;My name is [x]. I am a student in Dr. Shawn Graham\u0026rsquo;s HIST3000 at Carleton University. As part of our coursework, we are looking at how digital tools can be used to study local history and archaeology and in particular, for recording how gravestones change over time. I am writing to ask permission to visit [cemetery name] to take digital photographs and measurements of the older monuments. This work does not involve any physical manipulation of or interference with the monuments or grounds. I would not visit the cemetery during a service or otherwise interfere. The information that I record will only be used in the context of the class exercises. Dr. Graham would be happy to chat with you to explain in more detail about the exercise and how the data will be handled or discuss any questions you may have. He can be contacted via email at shawn.graham@carleton.ca or by phone at 613-520-2828 (the main History department reception). I look forward to hearing from you; my contact details are below. Yours sincerely, [your name]\u0026rdquo; I can\u0026rsquo;t access reading x? Many of the links to readings are via our university library. Try logging into the library website first before clicking on the link. If you\u0026rsquo;re logged into the library, and the link still doesn\u0026rsquo;t work for you (it\u0026rsquo;ll have \u0026lsquo;proxy.library.carleton.ca\u0026rsquo; in the url) contact me. Other links are to copies that I\u0026rsquo;ve secreted on this website and you should have no issue accessing those. Sometimes, links die and websites go offline. If this describes the situation, let me know right away. I pulled this course together some months before term started. Try dropping the link into the Wayback Machine at the Internet Archive; sometimes a page might\u0026rsquo;ve been saved. \u0026hellip;and of course, sometimes I just screw up the html for this website and break the link. Let me know if you get a \u0026lsquo;404\u0026rsquo; file-not-found error. Click on this link to see what that looks like Why aren\u0026rsquo;t readings listed alphabetically? Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s because I know that you\u0026rsquo;ll read things in the order that I present them, and there\u0026rsquo;s an implied emergent narrative. Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s because I forgot to. Sometimes, it\u0026rsquo;s because I\u0026rsquo;m messing with convention. I\u0026rsquo;m having tech troubles, what do I do? send me an email with a subject line that summarizes the exact issue you\u0026rsquo;re having. You should write the subject line last after you\u0026rsquo;ve written the body of your email; that way you will actually understand the issue you\u0026rsquo;re having explain what you were doing, what you expected to happen, what actually happened, what precise step you were at when you encountered the problem, and describe the difficulty you are having. help me reproduce the problem so I can understand what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Provide screenshots, take a video. Walk me through what you\u0026rsquo;re doing. then, when you\u0026rsquo;ve done all that, send the email and be patient. Wait three days before asking again if you don\u0026rsquo;t hear from me (I\u0026rsquo;m not ignoring you, I just get a lot of email.) Help each other out. As the course progresses, you will have many opportunities to ask for help from me and from your peers - post these in our discord server in the appropriate channel. Sometimes, you will see questions that you can answer. Answering the questions of your peers, helping them out, is an excellent way to meet one of the course outcomes. A few guidelines for answering questions: There are many different ways to solve these issues; someone might post a different way but that doesn’t mean that either of you are necessarily wrong. Read the question carefully. Request clarification if there are bits that the original poster didn’t make clear - help them to ask better questions. Use screenshots and screenvideo (I find screencastomatic handy in this regard) to show how things worked for you. Provide links to useful relevant material if you know of it. Assume the best of everyone: not everyone has the same fluency with these machines, and it takes a while to learn the language. Do not, for the time being, drop any code or issue through a generative language model (AI), looking for \u0026rsquo;the answer\u0026rsquo;, unless I have explicitly suggested you do this. What kind of citation style should I use? I\u0026rsquo;m not that fussed, so long as you\u0026rsquo;re consistent. I tend to follow Internet Archaeology: Harvard Style. The main rule of thumb is to provide as much information as possible. If there is no date, use the abbreviation n.d. Do not abbreviate journal titles. No brackets or full stops around year of publication. Single quotes around journal/chapter titles. Journal/Book titles in italics. Volume numbers in bold. Page number ranges may be elided but full ranges where there may be ambiguity. DOIs where available should be cited in full (https://doi.org/10.11141/ia.24.8 not doi:10.11141/ia.24.8). Distinguish between publications by same author in same year with a,b,c etc. Websites and other digital resources without DOIs should state a Last accessed date. Why is there so much stuff to read? Because this is an online asynchronous class and I loathe video. So read carefully, fully, and take your time. When was that podcast recorded? It was a few years ago. But it features interviews with digital archaeologists whom I respect and whose observations are still germane and worth the listen. Please ignore anything that obviously dates it. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there\u0026rsquo;s anything in there where I directly instruct you re anything concerning assessment etc, but if you suspect there is, please email me for clarification. Hypothes.is doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem to work with website x? Sometimes, a website will have its own annotation layer already. In such a case, Hypothes.is won\u0026rsquo;t work. You can try their proxy service (go to https://via.hypothes.is/ and paste the url in), but there\u0026rsquo;s no guarantee. If you can\u0026rsquo;t annotate, don\u0026rsquo;t worry. Just make regular ol\u0026rsquo; notes as you read. I ask you to annotate as you read because again, this is an active process that makes a difference for how you learn things, and what you pay attention to. By making reading social you can also see where something sparks thoughts, confusion, connections for your peers. I worked alone for many years. It\u0026rsquo;s hard to learn that way. Given that this is an asynchronous classroom, we have to make an extra effort to obtain the social dimension without which learning is incomplete. I\u0026rsquo;m using Obsidian in another class. Can that work here? Yes; obsidian is a piece of software meant for note-making, and it understands wikilink syntax. It will not (by default) see or permit you to edit .ipynb files. But you could have both obsidian and jupyter lab desktop (our workbench) open at the same time, working on the same folder. I have not tested this. But I see no reason why this wouldn\u0026rsquo;t work. If you\u0026rsquo;re asking this question, I will assume that I don\u0026rsquo;t need to explain Obsidian any further; but if you\u0026rsquo;re someone who\u0026rsquo;s only just encountered it and would like some guidance, just send me a note.

COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses. PLAGIARISM The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include: reproducing or paraphrasing portions of someone else’s published or unpublished material, regardless of the source, and presenting these as one’s own without proper citation or reference to the original source; submitting a take home examination, essay, laboratory report or other assignment written, in whole or in part, by someone else; using ideas or direct, verbatim quotations, or paraphrased material, concepts, or ideas without appropriate acknowledgment in any academic assignment; using another’s data or research findings; failing to acknowledge sources through the use of proper citations when using another’s works and/or failing to use quotation marks; handing in \u0026ldquo;substantially the same piece of work for academic credit more than once without prior written permission of the course instructor in which the submission occurs.\u0026rdquo; Plagiarism is a serious offence which cannot be resolved directly with the course’s instructor. The Associate Dean of the Faculty conducts a rigorous investigation, including an interview with the student, when an instructor suspects a piece of work has been plagiarized. Penalties are not trivial. They can include a final grade of \u0026ldquo;F\u0026rdquo; for the course. COURSE SHARING WEBSITES and COPYRIGHT To the degree that I am able, all original content on this course website is released under creative commons licensed.

The establishment of these policies and procedures was the culmination of the efforts of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Human Rights and a Human Rights Implementation Committee.] GRADING SYSTEM Letter grades assigned in this course will have the following percentage equivalents: Grade A+ = 90-100 (12) B = 73-76 (8) C - = 60-62 (4) F= 0-49 (0) – Failure: no academic credit A = 85-89 (11) B - = 70-72 (7) D+ = 57-59 (3) A - = 80-84 (10) C+ = 67-69 (6) D = 53-56 (2) B+ = 77-79 (9) C = 63-66 (5) D - = 50-52 (1) The following additional final course grades may be assigned by instructors: DEF Official deferral of final exam (see \u0026ldquo;Petitions to Defer\u0026rdquo;) GNA Grade not available. This is used when there is an allegation of an academic offence. The notation is replaced with the appropriate grade for the course as soon as it is available. IP In Progress – a notation (IP) assigned to a course by a faculty member when: At the undergraduate level, an undergraduate thesis or course has not been completed by the end of the period of registration. WDN Withdrawn. No academic credit, no impact on the CGPA. WDN is a permanent notation that appears on the official transcript for students who withdraw after the full fee adjustment date in each term (noted in the Academic Year section of the Calendar each term). Students may withdraw on or before the last day of classes. Standing in a course is determined by the course instructor subject to the approval of the Faculty Dean. This means that grades submitted by the instructor may be subject to revision. No grades are final until they have been approved by the Dean. WITHDRAWAL WITHOUT ACADEMIC PENALTY September 30, 2025: Last day for a full fee adjustment when withdrawing from full fall and fall/winter (full year) courses (financial withdrawal). November 15, 2025: Last day for academic withdrawal. REQUESTS FOR ACADEMIC ACCOMMODATIONS You may need special arrangements to meet your academic obligations during the term. For an accommodation request the processes are as follows: Pregnancy obligation: write to the professor with any requests for academic accommodation during the first two weeks of class, or as soon as possible after the need for accommodation is known to exist.

Always: humans. An archaeological perspective on this pays attention to entanglements and flows. And if we apply the appropriate lenses to how we look, we might begin to understand why and how. Spend some time with Kate Crawford\u0026rsquo;s Calculating Empires to see what I mean (you\u0026rsquo;ll want to open this in a new browser window; try taking the audio tour, too). My Philosophy of Learning As a general philosophy of learning, I do not aim for \u0026lsquo;coverage\u0026rsquo; of a topic. Rather, by exploring a topic as a series of connected stories or lenses I am trying to help you learn the skills that you will need to uncover whatever aspect of method and thought that will help you with your own research goals. I\u0026rsquo;m trying to give you frameworks and practice for deep reflective thinking. You might have expectations about what \u0026lsquo;university writing\u0026rsquo; looks like and you are trying very hard to fit those expectations. That gets things exactly backwards. Scholarly writing is what we do to figure out what we think. I therefore am trying to give you practice in getting set up for that moment. It\u0026rsquo;s about unpacking the game and the way scholarly thinking works. I want you to swing for the bleachers, and not to be afraid of whiffing on the ball. After all, to mix sporting metaphors, you’re here for ice-time, not the Stanley Cup. You have to do the work, right? Learning is an active thing. This is a course aimed at the first year student, newly arrived at Carleton. To be honest, such a person has not yet learned how to be a university student. All of the assessment therefore is geared towards creating the foundational habits-of-thought upon which you can build a successful learning experience. It\u0026rsquo;s weight training for your mind. So\u0026hellip; no essays. But I guarantee you: you\u0026rsquo;ll write better essays elsewhere after this class. Text/Tech To the best of my ability, all materials will either be open access materials on the web or materials made available to us through MacOdrum Library or the University. You will not be required to purchase any set text or software. Class format This class happens on Mondays and Wednesdays, 11.35 am - 12.55 pm, in LA C264. AI All of the assessment happens in-class, by hand. This is because you do not have the scholarly background yet to deal with AI yet. If you went to a gym, and there was a machine that lifted weights up and down for you, could you say that you\u0026rsquo;ve had a work-out, if the machine moved the weights around? Because isn\u0026rsquo;t that the point of a gym: moving weights from A to B? So a machine would be more efficient, and better at it? \u0026hellip;Right? That sound you hear is of a point being missed. The correct answer is, \u0026rsquo;no\u0026rsquo;. The correct answer is, we lift the weights so that our muscles undergo the process of strengthening, conditioning, developing. In the same way, the use of any generative AI system to create written work in a class is a pointless stupid thing to do. In the same way having a machine lift weights for you misses the point, so too does having a machine generate a \u0026lsquo;paper\u0026rsquo;. (Which incidentally will be just formed from statistical chains of plausible bullshit.) You\u0026rsquo;re in university to develop your mind, not to have a stack of papers on your desk. Process Is The Point You lift weights so that your body undergoes the process. The process is the point. You write to train your mind to think, to put your mind through a process. The point was never to have x number of things-written. Yet, many people seem to treat university as the accumulation of papers in exchange for a piece of paper. That is profoundly sad. But because AI is, at heart, a web technology, we will be looking at it and exploring some parts of it so that you can properly situate it in its broader context (and if you want to get a headstart at that, try \u0026lsquo;Models All The Way Down\u0026rsquo;. THAT WILL BE THE ONLY TIME where it will be ok to work with generative AI in this course. Lift the weights for yourself. Anything else is\u0026hellip; point-less. Null points. 0.

Meaning depends on context. Nothing exists on its own. In the process of becoming, we respond to the materials we work with, and they respond to us. Therefore, networks (of all kinds) are fundamental to how we live in the world. A network is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows. Network shapes and flow give rise to emergent structures. Networks also are a mechanism through which computation can happen. Networks are the substrate of social life, and networks exist in the physical world and leave traces. Digital media extend our cognition into and through electrical and magnetic relationships. The components of a networked history are an assemblage (which in this context means \u0026lsquo;a coming together\u0026rsquo;). The \u0026lsquo;internet\u0026rsquo; is just a handy phrase to describe an emergent structure of many networks of many kinds. What is the history of the internet understood this way? It\u0026rsquo;s more than a simple sequence of x was invented in 1934; y was invented in 1955, I know that much. This course is a formalized exploration of these questions and ideas; I do not know the answers! I\u0026rsquo;m excited to figure these out with you. Outcomes By the end of this class, you ought to be able to Situate the emergence and evolution of the Internet in the historiography of digital technology more generally Assess relevant scholarly literature for key themes and findings Organize research and begin to implement personal knowledge management techniques for your scholarly reading and note making Texts See the weekly work section. All readings are open access. Do the reading before the class in question. When Life Intervenes There\u0026rsquo;s nothing we can\u0026rsquo;t roll with, in this class. That said, I can\u0026rsquo;t help you if I don\u0026rsquo;t know you need help, a breathing space, some direction. When something comes up, just let me know: Trust. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to share the details with me. It is enough for me to know that something is up. I trust you. When something comes up and this course has to move to the backburner, contact me and we can figure out something else to do, or something else that will help you be successful here. It\u0026rsquo;s our course - we can change things up as we need to. Just put \u0026ldquo;something has come up\u0026rdquo; in the subject line. COVID IS STILL A THING \u0026lsquo;Oh it\u0026rsquo;s just a really bad cold\u0026rsquo;. No, it\u0026rsquo;s not. But politically, that\u0026rsquo;s the story we tell. I fully expect that at some point during the term, COVID and its complications will happen to some of you. When this happens (whether or not it\u0026rsquo;s formally diagnosed), just email me and say that \u0026ldquo;something has come up\u0026rdquo;. I don\u0026rsquo;t require a dr\u0026rsquo;s note, or any of the details. Honestly, I don\u0026rsquo;t. Again, I trust you, and we\u0026rsquo;ll figure something else out.

Getting the workflow set up involves creating a place to lodge your materials (a data repository via Github), a place to make notes and explore code (we\u0026rsquo;re going to use a thing called JupyterLite), and a way of being social with your community of nascent digital archaeologists (a social annotation layer for the web called Hypothes.is). You might already have a system you use for making notes and keeping track of things, which is good. But for this course, I want you to engage with my system because it intersects with broader issues around open access research, replicability, and knowledge-making in digital archaeology that I want you to learn. Therefore, this week our goals are: understanding what the hang you\u0026rsquo;ve signed up for getting a sense of what digital archaeology is; also, the importance of a space where it is \u0026lsquo;safe to fail\u0026rsquo; getting your data repository set up on Github getting your collaborative reading environment with Hypothes.is set up exploring our JupyterLite digital notemaking and analytical environment Listen Your browser does not support the audio element. Right-click and save-as this link to download the audio file Advice on how to listen to a podcast for a class. It\u0026rsquo;s not as straightforward as you might think. Each week, this podcast interviews a different digital archaeologist. These interviews were conducted a while ago. One thing I want you to ask yourself therefore is \u0026lsquo;how might things have changed in the interim?\u0026rsquo; Listen for key words and phrases. A good idea would be to use OpenAlex, Google Scholar, JSTOR, or our library to search these terms to find articles from the last five years that are germane. DO Listen to the podcast Follow the instructions to get Github and Hypothes.is set up Annotate the syllabus part of this website while being logged into our private Hypothesis group; here\u0026rsquo;s the link if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already joined (indeed as with the readings mentioned above, and with all annotations for this class, always make the annotations as part of our group). Use the 3 w\u0026rsquo;s: what is ‘weird’ (eg, unfamiliar to your experience or expectations), ‘wonderful’ (eg, makes you see your studies in a new or exciting way), or ‘worrying’ (eg, something that seems problematic to you) I ask you to do this so that you get familiar with the hypothesis workflow. Notice that any annotation you make gets its own unique permanent link, so you can link to it in any notes or writing you do. Notice that you can also responde to anyone else\u0026rsquo;s annotation. Install our lab bench environment. It has a bundled getting started tutorial that explains what the lab bench does, and how it works. Complete that tutorial. Read the readings. Have Hypothes.is turn on so you can make similar annotations, or respond to others\u0026rsquo; observations. Make notes on the readings in your lab-bench. How many? That\u0026rsquo;s up to you. Better note-making and linked thinking leads to better grades, ultimately. Log your reflection in your appropriate github repository Readings to set the scene Morgan, Colleen. 2022.

Being a digital archaeologist means keeping track of what you’ve done, as a gift to your future self (ie, so that when you come back to something, you can pick up where you left off). In our digital lab, make a new markdown document, and put into it any new terms you’ve encountered, commands you used, error messages you encountered, websites that helped, and so on: this document is a lab notebook, as it were. Bullet points and memos-to-self are fine. Put this markdown document into your week one repo on github, along with any other files or digital things you happen to make. Call it your ‘wk1-memos.md’. In a new md document, jot down some reflections - narrative, or bullet points, whatever works for you; both are fine. Call it ‘journal-wk-1.md’ This document also goes into your week one repo on github. Begin the reflection by quoting (w/ citation) one sentence from the readings that resonates with you. You might select something that is personally meaningful, or leaves you confused, or makes you happy, or intrigues you to know more. Reflect on why that is. In this document, you will detail any issues you had with getting started, any parts that caused you difficulty, anything you annotated that you really want me to address for you. If you got any error messages while trying to get set up, copy those into your reflection; google them. Do you find any websites that help you? What kind of ‘failures’ might you have encountered this week? Going beyond the mere mechanical aspects of getting started, draw on your annotations of what you’ve read (and/or your notes from what you’ve listened to), discuss your idea of what ‘digital archaeology\u0026rsquo; might be prior to starting this course, and think through whether any of the materials we’ve seen this week confirm or upset those notions.

Build a static site generator with Pelican Some other options you can play with, if time/energy/interest permits: It\u0026rsquo;s getting towards the end of term and I don\u0026rsquo;t want to clobber you. Storymapping is a useful way for communicating archaeological materials to a wider public. A storymap can be a website that mixes storytelling with mapping. It\u0026rsquo;s related to \u0026lsquo;scrollytelling\u0026rsquo;, which similarly mixes datavisualization and annotation with long-form journalism. See for instance how effectively this piece on early women archaeologists uses a story-map framework to highlight an often-overlooked aspect of the history of archaeology. That piece uses software from the GIS company Esri (which might, actually, be available to you via the Library). You can make your own version using the free KnightLab StoryMap.js framework. So if you\u0026rsquo;re looking to push yourself this week, why not give that a try and use it to tell me the story of say one of these early Canadian archaeologists?

There are two graded assignments left - consolidation doc III and the exit ticket. Of these, the exit ticket is imagined as a kind of consolidation of the consolidations, and a chance for you to argue for a final grade if you so desire to do (perhaps sickness or other issues meant that your earlier work doesn’t accurately reflect what you’ve learned, etc). Those two documents are each worth 25% of your final grade. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot.

With tech work, if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t come together in about 30 minutes, it won\u0026rsquo;t come in an hour. So take a break. Close the laptop. Call somebody up for help.

Insights from Post-Colonial India Complutum 24.2, 189-201 link Do \u0026ldquo;Since 2009 the Gabii Project, an international archaeological initiative led by Nicola Terrenato and the University of Michigan, has been investigating the ancient Latin town of Gabii, which was both a neighbor of, and a rival to, Rome in the first millennium BC. The trajectory of Gabii, from an Iron Age settlement to a flourishing mid-Republican town to an Imperial agglomeration widely thought to be in decline, provides a new perspective on the dynamics of settlement in central Italy. This archive is based on the Gabii Project’s first digital publication, which focuses on the construction, inhabitation, and repurposing of a private home at Gabii, built in the mid-Republican period.\u0026rdquo; via Open Context First, you\u0026rsquo;re going to explore one of the Gabii project\u0026rsquo;s data repositories and consider how we move from observations to a story about the site, using materials designed by Paulina Przystupa and Meghan Daniels, scholars with the Alexandria Archive Institute. These exercise do not require our digital workbench. Work through \u0026lsquo;Notes to Data\u0026rsquo; link Try your hand at making a Harris Matrix and tell me the story it reveals Work through \u0026lsquo;Data to Narrative\u0026rsquo; link The next bit. A few years ago I created a topic model (see this quick video for \u0026lsquo;what is a topic model\u0026rsquo;) on the full texts of 20 000 archaeological articles from 1935 to 2010-ish. I want you to explore it here. I want you to explore this because this gives us a macroscopic perspective of how stories about archaeological materials are told once we get to the level of the academic article: we\u0026rsquo;re a long way away from concerns about notes to data to lenses, and traditionally, archaeology hasn\u0026rsquo;t worried too much about this. When you visit my site with my topic model explorer, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a lot of \u0026lsquo;bubbles\u0026rsquo;. Each of the bubbles is a ‘topic’; if you click on ‘years’ you’ll see a ‘stream graph’, or the proportion each topic accounts for that year’s total archaeological writing output (in English speaking journals). Notice the inflection points? What was going on in the world at those points? (Remember there’s a lag between work being done, and work being published). What other patterns do you notice? Are there topics that perhaps relate to the themes of this course? In what journals? By what authors? A bit of clarification: We’re used to ‘close reading’ in history, parsing individual words and sentences to understand what’s going on, reading between the lines and so on. By contrast, a topic model takes a large scale, macroscopic view: what patterns are visible when we soar up to 20 000 feet, as it were: what are large scale patterns in archaeology? So this is a way of getting a sense of archaeology’s historiographic evolution. By ‘explore’ then, I want you to use the different facets of the visualization tool to spot patterns, and then dive back down to the ‘micro’ view presented by our readings/course materials. Cycle between close and distant; identify ideas at the micro, then see what correlates at the macro (search for words, ideas, etc, in the tool) World Archaeology tries to be a much more …global… journal. It’s not included in the 20 000 topic model. Here’s another topic model just for this particular journal. Explore, and contrast this with the previous.
