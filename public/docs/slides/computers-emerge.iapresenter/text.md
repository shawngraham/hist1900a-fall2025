Nov 12: computers! Start mar6 mauchly & Eniac for start of next piece; also use first few slides from mar6 and all of mar 8

Nov 17: I say 'on programming languages' but fuck what am I going to talk about this day, I talk about programming all over nov 12! Unless I can figure out a way to split the nov 12 across two sessions. Some kind of exercise?

Remember the problem of Ballistics?

more guns, more conditions of use emerging during the war than the computers/girls could keep up with
- had to tabulate dozens of factors for 1000s of possible trajectories; each one a half day's work. 'kilogirls' - cheeky unit-of-measurment of 1000 hours of work by a woman computer
- 15 tables being produced a week, but they needed 40.
- this the social necessity for a machine called ENIAC

Mauchly & ENIAC

![[eniacport2-1878887183.jpg]]

- Electronic Numerical Integrator and Calculator/Computer

note:
Prof at Urinus College; was interested in meteorology; despairing of all the calculations, took a summer course at Moore School of Electrical Engineering in 1941 to learn about electronic devices. In 1940, had heard a paper by John Atanasoff describing the design of an electronic calculator he was building, that instead of relays, would use vacuum tube valves. In the summer of 1941, Mauchly visits Atanasoff and learns more about it.

After his time at Moore School, Mauchly gets a faculty post there; invites Atanasoff to join. A declines. In 1942, Mauchly writes a memo 'The Use of High Speed Vaccum Tube Devices for Calculating'

- this memo gets lost. But Herman Goldstine naval attache officer working at the moore school - overseeing ballist firing table generation on an analogue differential analyzer - mentions it to the operator as perhaps a better way of doing this.

they go looking, can't find it: it's 1943 now- Mauchly's secretary reconstructs the memo from her shorthand dictation notebook! and presents it Oswald Veblen (connection to neumann - Veblen was at Institute for Advanced STudy from 1932 onwards) who oversaw the Ballistics Research Laboratory - 'give him the money!' 

Goldstine and Mauchly write a detailed proposal & costing by 1943; work began that June. Brings in Presper Eckert (who handled a lot of the valve work) - 17 000 tubes, 100 000 pulses a second, therefore 1.7 billion opportunities to break down every second!!!

took 3 years to build (war rationing). By 1945, it was ready for testing. They do a public unveiling, setting up a ballistics question for it to calculate in front of a live audience - which it did, taking 20 seconds, or shorter than the actual calculated shell would've flown! They also made a point of saying that the 'girls' could compute this in 3 days, the differential analyzer in 30 minutes, ENIAC in 20 seconds.  The first programmable, electronic, general purpose computer. (although a court case in 1974 would say the Atanasoff was the first)

note:
- prevailing sexism of all of this: computers were girls; they broke the problem up and did the math; our machine can do math; the girls can figure out how to put the problem on it.

This requires *incredible sophistication* and understanding of both pure mathematics AND engineering.

![[babbage-lovelace-cartoon.png]]

note:
Lovelace can't publish her thoughts on the engine on her own; but she can translate the work of the italian scholar Menebrae, who heard Babbage talk in Turin (he was there to drum up finances to give it all a go) and wrote his own thoughts. Lovelace translates the work, but then annotates it with so much of her own work that she wrote triple the length of the original article. In it she describes how to set Babbage's engine in train, in order to calculate such things as Bernoulli numbers; conceptualizes how other kinds of things might get computed - ie, thinking in terms of symbolic logic. HOWEVER, she dies at 36 years of age (uterine cancer) and her work for most part fades away (becomes known again in 20th century). But in order to program the machine, she had to understand its engineering completely. Babbage jus had to figure out how to add, subtract, etc. Lovelace had the harder job.

Grace Hopper

![[grace-hopper-3-1622874945.jpg|600]]

note:
Mathematics prof at Vassar, joins the war effort in the Navy; because Aiken and the mark 1 are being funded partially by the navy, she ends up working for him. Day 1, he hands her a complex set of equations and says, 'figure it out, you have one week.'
- studies wiring diagrams, card reader manuals, whatever technical schematics exist - even in the face of 'hey you're a woman'- mark 1 is a paper tape machine, so every alogirthm is linear, no loops; writes the freakin' manual for this machine and its successors - 500 pgs! - doesn't even get her name on it. Trains other women too.

note:
Kleiman: They had to track each piece of data, wire it into a panel, such as a multiplier or a ‘square rooter,’ and then move the result — physically by wire — to another panel for storage,” she said.

The women kept track of the steps and diagrams for the wires manually on what they called “pedaling sheets.” As Bartik described it: “ENIAC was a son of a b— to program,” she said in the documentary “[The Computers](http://eniacprogrammers.org/).” Eniac could handle branching logic and loops. These women write the first algorithms that could write their own algorithms! they come up with idea of subroutines and packaging little pieces of code together for reuse, assigning symbolic letters/numbers to these, to speed up programming work. Grace Hopper comes to work with the MCC company; horizontally flat company, women there in lots of positions of authority; MCC isn't a good business though. Bought by Rand in 1950; now the women have to work in a hierarchy and report to men who don't understand what's going on. The salesmen can't figure out how to sell the machines, so the women do that too. AND the women provide the tech support to the clients so that they can get their machines to do whatever they want. Rand only figures they'll build 6 machines a year; in the first two years, the women sell 42 machines. These women built programming, they built support, they built sales, they built use cases and business cases for the existence of the machines. (Rand gets bought out in 1955 by Sperry, becomes Sperry Rand)

my point - the work that no one valued - the actual operation of things, the doing of the tedious calculations - that gets coded 'female' very early on, and while everything depends upon it, no one in power treats it as important. But by tying it to digital computing, it becomes a superpower, and so a pattern repeats itself: women are devalued, pushed out. They end up training their (male) replacements.

We're now in the period of digital incunabula

The missing supervening social necessity? Nuclear War

note:
We'll take a detour to see what has been happening in Britain at this same period - Alan Turing, the BOMBE, COLOSSUS, and the way the British squandered their computing prowess on the twin alters of class & misogyny.

von Neumann got a team of Manhattan project (from Los Alamos) came w/ a problem for ENIAC to calculate - related to the bom, and I *think* the shaping of the implossive charge that triggers fission.

![[Alan_Turing_Aged_16.jpg|300]]
[Alan Turing](https://turingarchive.kings.cam.ac.uk/)

'[On Computable Numbers, with an application to the *Entscheidungsproblem*](https://ocul-crl.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/permalink/01OCUL_CRL/hgdufh/alma9951907063505162)'

note:
just like everything else in the 19th century, things in mathematics are hotting up. there is a movement to put all of mathematics onto a rational, systematic basis by developing axioms that could be the building blocks of a 'total' mathematics. In 1931 Kurt Godel demonstrates that you can't build a proof around the consistency of a mathematical system that describes all of mathematics

I don't pretend to understand the mathematics completely, but the upshot is that there are true mathematical statements that cannot be proved from whatever the system is you're working in. In which case, how can you know if you're dealing with a problem that cannot be proved? How do you decide what to do? This is the 'decidability' problem- Entscheidunsproblem.  Much fighting ensues.

Turing builds a thought experiment, creating a machine to explore this problem

---

The turing machine

_I'm not even gonna try to illustrate this one because it always does my head in_

[but this is a pretty straightforward explanation of how it works](https://www.futurelearn.com/info/courses/how-computers-work/0/steps/49259)


note:
- remember too that when he says 'computer' he means, a person who computes; he describes how a human computer breaks down a problem into its component parts, and each observation he makes changes his 'state' of mind; he makes a direct correlation between a human computer's state of mind and a particular configuration of his machine.
- his machine can read, write, scan & remember binary numbers on a tape. Calls it a 'universal engine' in homage to Charles Babbage (remember, most of Babbages writings/Lovelace's writings about Babbage, weren't really in broad circulation. He was remembered, but not in detail)
- he uses this machine to test if there are any conditions where it can predict if it will fail, and if there are any conditions where it can predict whether a symbol will be printed.
- this thought experiment enables him to figure out how to identify such problems; a side effect of his 'machine' is that it can compute any computable sequence
- thus a machina ratiocinatrix- tying a machine's state to a human's state of mind - meant that a thinking machine was possible.
- Turing might've been first to publish, but not by much. Alonzo Church, Emil Post, publish similar work within *months* - per Winston, why is this unsurprising?
- note also that Turing's machine depends on Boolean algebra, which reduces logical statements to on/off states.
- a turing machine manipulates *symbols*. That's the big thing.

---

Combine information theory with Turing's 'universal computer' and you have a way for a machine computer to simulate any of the work a human computer could do.

note:

John von Neumann

- mathematician, significant contributions across multiple fields
- heavily involved with Manhattan Project (had expertise on mathematics of shaped explosives), early digital computation; professor with Institute for Advanced Study (in Princeton)

In a hugely influential report from 1945, he explicitly makes the connection between the use of telephone relay technologies (circuits) which can be in discrete states, with the way that neurons in animal brains work. Explicitly making the connection between switches/bits/information and cognition (even if we still don't really understand how that works in the brain)
- this is also a long tradition in western thought where we think of the human through the metaphor of whatever technology is currently dominant (mechanemorphism)
- works the other way to: we talk about computer memory and languages
- you get a lot of 'electronic brains' in the press of this period. Anyway, we'll hear more about von Neumann in due course

---

Speaking of metaphors... back to Babbage

note:
Turing knew of Babbage's work; he framed his language of his 'universal machine' in terms that paid hommage to Babbage
- turing's machine was to use punch cards
	- one set: instructions
	- other set: data to work on
	- input data & intervening computations get kept in a 'store' - Babbage using language of the weaving industry
	- the actual computing done in the 'mill'. Babbage designs it to do branching operations (logic) by jumping between the mill and support; prints out results

Ok, back to the war: Turing is working at Bletchley Park

COLOSSUS


developed during WWII
emerges from the Bombe
never fully declassified until well after the war
supervening necessity: German wolfpack
note:
Keeping shipping open, avoiding german u-boats, meant the British really REALLY needed to break German cyphers

ENIGMA


note:

based perhaps on the ideas used in a commerical machine developed by Edward Hebern aimed at banks and business and anyone who didn't want their messages being read on the telegraph; although like everything else, others were working on similar cyphering devices based on rotors
German: Arthur Scherbius - calls his 'enigma', meaning, 'riddle'
typewriter key, wired to lights showing letters. substitution cypher - A becomes Q. But if you can change the wiring with each keystroke, becomes a polyalphabetic substitution cipher. Easy to break, with one rotor. But with two rotors, 26 × 26 = 676 letters, but you only need to know two letters/numbers to set up/decrypt. 3 rotors: 17,576
add a bit more enigneering: Combining three rotors from a set of five, each of the 3 rotor setting with 26 positions, and the plug board with ten pairs of letters connected, the military Enigma has 158,962,555,217,826,360,000 (nearly 159 quintillion) different settings. (5 × 4 × 3) × (263) × [26! / (6! × 10! × 210)] = 158,962,555,217,826,360,000.
Scherbius dies in a cart accident in 1928. By mid 1930s, every branch of german military using the machines
a quirk of the machine was that no letter could be encyphered as itself; this eventually is the crack into which the wedge is driven to break the codes
polish gov't sees what's coming down the pipe - they'd broken the 3-rotor machine by mid 30s; mere weeks before the invastion, Poles shared what they knew/techniques with the French and Germans. Throughout the war, the game becomes adding complexity to the machines, and then trying to break those machines.
the poles created a machine called 'the Bombas' that basically reverse-engineered Enigma. But everytime more rotors get added to enigma, the previous 'bombas' is no longer useful
Hut 8 & Bletchly Park


note:

Government Code & Cyper School - Bletchly Park
Turing and his crew worked in hut 8 on the problem of cracking the naval Enigma machines
they knew the principles, and had good idea of its design.
Turing et all worked to improve the Bombe machines - specialized calculators - to break the codes
dozen mathemtaicians, 4 linguists, 100+ others all women apparently
drawing on a tradition of specialized electro-mechanical devices for mathematical research in Britain; simpler machine in many respects than what Zuse or Aitken or Mauchly were doing. But then again, the need was much greater.
they focussed on 'probable words' that were used as the keys to set the rotors up in the first place; plaintext was used in some messages, and keeping track of what plaintext was used and in what contexts eventually gives them a method for starting to test possible keys. Sometimes they'd spot messages sent in less secure ways being retransmitted on more secure machines, so breaking it on the lesser machine would give a key to the stronger.
the bombe would churn through the possibilities; by 1941 they could crack a message in a day
by 1942 germans added another rotor; Allies didn't know, until a radio operator sent a message with one wheel turned off, then corrected himself and sent the same message again with a wheel turned on thus revealing existence of a new wheel.
"It was luck the security people didn't know [about Turing being gay] early on, because if they had known, he might not have obtained his clearnace and we might have lost the war"

a member of Turing's team.
note:

Without any hint of irony.

Bombe to Colossus


(this is a bombe)

Turing's teacher, Max Newman, leads design of Colossus
Colossus could suggest best match for a pattern within a text
second colossus could figure out which pattern was best to try
integrating valves the key
note:

German encryption required more powerful devices
British build a device that can do boolean operations, but is more similar to the analogue computers of vannevar bush; but also involves valves and relays and paper-tape readers.
a rickety device: didn't have to be pretty, just had to work.
to improve things, they work out how to store the patterns to search for encoded in valves, and so only the messages they're intercepting have to be put on the machine.
by 1943 allies are able to neutralise german encryption again; many estimate this shaves two to three years off the war
anyway, this makes ENIAC & COLOSSUS sit astride the phase transition from powerful calculators to full-on computers
the difference is that a full on computer must have a datastore in which its operating instructions are held, and which can be varied because of the calculations being done.,
Post War Developments Doldrums
multiple teams are exploring these machines that sit on the calculator/computer barrier
von Neumann writes the 'First Draft of a Report on The EDVAC' 1945
but for the most part, the urgency is gone; everyone losing steam, in terms of computing design
last technical hurdle to solve is the problem of memory (many solutions mooted, workable)
note:

von Neumann's paper circulates widely; it describes the kinds of things a computer - a proper computer - ought to have, given what they now knew about such devices. One author puts it like this: "It was as if, in the early 1890s, somebody had specified, in some detail, the fundamental design elements of an automobile - and that this document acted prescriptively to limit the range of options available to engineers in the decades following"
Influenced Turing, Mauchely, the folks at the Institute of Advanced Studies in Princeton, anyone who was into these devices read this report.
From One Supervening Necessity to Another
Project Whirlwind
starts off as a kind of analogue computer meant to simulate flight on multiple kinds of airplanes being developed during the war
most expensive of the various computing projects; navy loses interest
airforce takes over: the only machine that could plot intercept courses for strategic long range bombers
solves the problem of magnetic memory
note:

didn't work all that well at first

ENIAC happens; Whirlwind rejigged for digital real-time output and parallel processing
it could even display its output on an oscilloscope in real time
construction starts in '49, by '49 it works
led by Jay Forrester. Who also develops key ideas, later on, in system dynamics. Which inspire Will Wright, who encodes these into Sim City; Forrester had some dodgy ideas about urban values, and so those somewhat regressive ideas have now informed generations of gamers - but I digress.

the cold war provides the new supervening necessity. new weapons, new simulations, new global-spanning aircraft then missles and space all require computing power

the first computer installed at the Insitute for Advanced Study in Princeton - ready to go by 1951 and one of the first problems they ran on it came from the Los Alamos nuclear folks, running 60 days 24/hrs a day.

Because the US has its research & industrial/military work distributed across labs and quasi-competitive research groups, a plethora of new computers all emerge, largely based on the design of the machine at IAS - MANIAC, ORDVAC, ILLIAC, AVIDAC, ORACLE, JOHNNIAC; and all of these machines have to be programmed, and a programming approach for each one designed & developed from scratch

soviets detonate atomic bomb 1949; americans respond with h-bomb in 1952. You need digital computers.


caption says 'Joe Thompson at Whirlwind console'. Who was Joe Thompson?

Meanwhile in Britain
Manchester Baby
built to test another solution to the problem of memory
runs a stored program from memory in 1948 - another 'first computer!' moment


note:

the prevailing idea that all computers had to be big and monstrous meant that this machine, which was quickly designed and was relatively small and which worked didn't take off, remained a curiosity. They returned to building big room-filling machines.
Allies no longer sharing information
act of congress in 1946 closes off data sharing with allies over nuclear work
Britain sets out to build its own expertise
Decides that all such experiments ought to be centralised at the National Physical Laboratory
The 'official' British Computer will be built at NPL, and they turn to Turing to make it, the 'Automatic Computing Engine'
note:

work as at Manchester also shows how successful Britain's boffins were at controlling things though. Manchester only got funding for their machine by saying it'd be used for 'pure' phsyics/maths research - same gambit that von Neumann used for getting computing work happening at the Institute for Advanced Studies in the US
minor official in the bureaucracy decided however that there was no use for ACE and worked to obstruct turing
because of the official secrets act, Turing couldn't explain to this bureaucrat the significance of what he was trying to do
The Death of Alan Turing
Turing moves to Manchester to work on computing 1948
His house is burgled; he calls the police. In the course of their investigation, Turing is forced to admit he is homosexual. 1952
He was found guilty of gross indecency; imprisonment or probation with chemical castration
loses security clearances. Chooses castration.
commits suicide 1954
pardoned in 2012
note:

cold war paranoia about the 'right' sort of person also felled Mauchley. Remember ENIAC and Eckert & Mauchly's computer company, its take-over by Rand?. The month the first UNIVAC computer shipped, in 1952 - Mauchley stripped of his security clearance for supposed communist ties: he had signed a petition for civilian control of nuclear power
this same paranoia would also destroy britain's domestic computing industry, as they tried to weed out women and other 'unreliable' types in favour of public-school educated old boys. Harold Wilson mandates a nationalization of computing industry in 1965, just a godawful mess. See Mar Hicks, Programmed Inequality
The Period of the Digital Incunabula is Over
In the UK, commerical versions of the Manchester 'Baby' are being sold by the Ferranti corporation as general purpose business computers by 1951
By 1952, IAS machine comes online
The digital age begins
"There will never be enough problems, enough work for more than one or two of these computers... stop this foolishness with Eckert and Mauchly" - I wonder if Aitken ate those words
note:
one of these Ferranti machines went to the U of T, helped design st lawrence seaway

IBM finally gets in on the act
Incidentally, on some accounts, this is when the digital humanities are born - Busa


note:

now that the pattern is established, IBM merely re-purposes existing devices
pushed into action by the way Rand was selling UNIVAC computers (thanks in large part to its women staff)
releases the '701' (with help from von Neumann and the IAS people, in exchange for equipment)
Programming still an issue
every computer has its own wiring, circuits, designs, idiosyncracies
people like Grace Hopper are building compilers and higher level languages to ease programming and provide some interoperability
mostly male programmers liked the secrecy of the way things were
note:

'the way things were' meant that they relied on the mystery of it all to maintain the positions, priviledges.
a lot of these tasks were highly sensitive operations, but since they relied on no one knowing what they were doing, they did a lot of work virtually in the open; security always gets bolted on afterwards
people using the Whirlwind computers developed a kind of language to work with it
Grace Hopper also the impetus behind the languages FORTRAN and BACAIC
IBM builds FORTRAN into its machines starting from about 1958
Upshot
every machine is unique
every machine is ever larger, more expensive
living on the gov't dime: both the funder, and buyer for these devices, largely.
Eventually, something's gotta give: is it an effective use of money to build machines like this that could often stand (comparatively) idle?
