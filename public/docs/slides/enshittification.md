# Enshittification
## The Inevitable Decay of Digital Platforms

*Understanding Cory Doctorow's Theory*

Note: Welcome to this presentation on enshittification - a concept that explains why our favorite platforms eventually turn against us.

## What is Enshittification?

> "Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves."

**â€” Cory Doctorow, 2023**

A systematic process where digital platforms progressively degrade their service quality to extract maximum value.

Note: Doctorow coined this term in 2023, though the pattern has been observable for years across major platforms.

## The Three-Stage Process

### Stage 1: **User Acquisition**
- Platforms prioritize user experience
- Services are free or cheap
- Focus on growth and engagement

### Stage 2: **Business Customer Focus**
- Users become the product
- Advertisers and business partners prioritized
- User experience begins to degrade

### Stage 3: **Value Extraction**
- Platform squeezes all parties
- Maximizes profit extraction
- Quality deteriorates rapidly

Note: Each stage represents a fundamental shift in who the platform serves and how value flows through the system.

## Why Does This Happen?

### **Network Effects**
- Users can't easily leave due to social connections
- "Everyone else is here" mentality
- High switching costs

### **Switching Costs**
- Data lock-in (photos, messages, connections)
- Learning new interfaces
- Loss of digital identity/history

### **Market Consolidation**
- Few viable alternatives
- Acquisition of competitors
- Regulatory capture

Note: These factors create a "walled garden" where users become trapped, allowing platforms to gradually extract more value.

## Classic Example: Facebook's Evolution

### **2004-2012: User Paradise**
- Clean, chronological timeline
- No ads, organic reach
- Privacy-focused messaging

### **2013-2019: Advertiser Heaven**
- Algorithm-driven feeds
- Promoted posts and ads
- Data harvesting for targeting

### **2020-Present: Value Extraction**
- Pay-to-reach your own audience
- Aggressive data collection
- Declining organic reach for creators

Note: Facebook's transformation perfectly illustrates the three-stage enshittification process over nearly two decades.

## The Amazon Marketplace Pattern

### **Early Days (2000s)**
- Best prices for consumers
- Easy returns and shipping
- Focus on customer satisfaction

### **Growth Phase (2010s)**
- Sellers flocked to the platform
- Amazon optimized for seller fees
- Introduction of sponsored products

### **Current State**
- Search results dominated by ads
- Counterfeit products proliferate
- Sellers squeezed by fees and competition

Note: Amazon shows how enshittification affects e-commerce, with fake reviews and sponsored results making genuine product discovery increasingly difficult.

## The Google Search Decline

### **The Golden Age**
- Relevant, useful results
- Minimal advertising
- Focus on information quality

### **The Ad Revolution**
- Sponsored results at top
- SEO gaming becomes profitable
- Content farms proliferate

### **Today's Reality**
- First page dominated by ads and AI-generated content
- Genuine expertise buried
- User intent secondary to ad revenue

Note: Google's search quality has notably declined as advertising revenue has taken priority over user experience.

## Why Traditional Antitrust Fails

### **The Competition Myth**
- "Users can switch" ignores network effects
- High barriers to entry for competitors
- Data advantages compound over time

### **The Innovation Excuse**
- Platforms claim features require scale
- Argue against "stifling innovation"
- Regulatory capture through lobbying

### **The Free Service Defense**
- "It's free, so what's the harm?"
- Ignores attention and data as payment
- Externalizes social and democratic costs

Note: Current antitrust law struggles with platform economics because it focuses on prices rather than quality degradation.

## Real-World Consequences

### **Democratic Impacts**
- Information manipulation and filter bubbles
- Undermining of shared truth
- Platform control over political discourse

### **Economic Effects**
- Small business dependence on platform access
- Creator economy exploitation
- Innovation stifling through acquisition

### **Social Costs**
- Mental health impacts from engagement optimization
- Privacy erosion
- Digital divide and platform dependency

Note: Enshittification isn't just about inconvenience - it has profound societal implications across democratic, economic, and social domains.

## Potential Solutions

### **Regulatory Approaches**
- **Interoperability mandates** - force platforms to work with competitors
- **Data portability rights** - let users take their data elsewhere
- **Algorithmic transparency** - require disclosure of ranking systems

### **Technical Solutions**
- **Decentralized platforms** - distribute power across networks
- **Open protocols** - create platform-independent standards
- **User-owned alternatives** - cooperative and non-profit models

### **Individual Actions**
- Diversify platform usage
- Support alternative platforms
- Advocate for regulatory change

Note: Solutions require both systemic change and individual awareness. The key is reducing platform power through competition and regulation.

## The Path Forward

### **Key Insights**
- Enshittification is **inevitable** under current conditions
- **User lock-in** is the fundamental enabler
- **Competition policy** must evolve for the digital age

### **The Choice**
We can accept platform decay as inevitable, or we can build systems that prioritize users over extraction.

The future of the internet depends on understanding and addressing the enshittification cycle.

Note: Doctorow's concept gives us a framework for understanding platform decay and points toward structural solutions rather than just individual responses.
