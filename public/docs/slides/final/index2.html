        </style></head><body><main class="prose prose-slate max-w-none"><div class="prose prose-slate max-w-none"><p>I have used several different themes to explore the multiple threads that can be woven together to create the 'history of the internet' - feminism, socialism, nationalism, labour, 'whig', 'history from below', 'imaginary', 'assemblages', 'archaeology', and so on. Think about everything we've read, seen, observed, and written in this course via one of those major themes. Then answer the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>1. Focussing on a major theme you have identified in this course, define some key moments/people/technology that illustrate the development of that theme and explain why and how these moments illuminate/shape our understanding of the history of the internet.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Again, you are meant to develop your response explicitly with reference to your observations and thoughts in your precis/memos/lecture notes/etc. (I am not worried about perfect citation format here; I understand that this is an exam situation.)</p>
<p>I am looking for evidence of meaningful reflection and deep engagement with the course. The best responses will draw from the entirety of the course (materials across the several modules). The best responses will put the materials of different writers/scholars in dialogue (ie., if author x says one thing, and author y says another, are they in contradiction? Agreement? Do they imply something new? Do they miss something important? etc). Mediocre responses recount merely a list of facts. As a suggestion, budget 80% of your time for this.</p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>2. How have you developed as a scholar over this course?</strong> Frame your response according to the course learning outcomes. <strong>Remember</strong>: There is no 'right' or 'wrong' to what you write in response to this question, but there is 'better' and 'worse' when it comes to explaining how your thinking has changed over time and pointing to the various things you've done that support that story. If you wish, you may then suggest to me an overall grade for the course that you think your work and presence warrants (based on the learning outcomes). As a suggestion, budget 20% of your time for this.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Reminder:
The course learning outcomes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Situate the emergence and evolution of the Internet in the historiography of digital technology more generally</li>
<li>Assess relevant scholarly literature for key themes and findings</li>
<li>Organize research and begin to implement personal knowledge management techniques for your scholarly reading and note makin</li>
</ul></div></main></body></html>
