### Entrance Ticket

One big idea that challenges you, from Bory's piece?

</div>

note:
hand out index cards; direct them to write their names, too. TPS: explain idea & why it challenges; Discuss; big ideas on the board, photo. group ideas. unconference separate major thoughts.

### What Makes A Good Annotation?

note:
- tps time! draw attention to precis/thomas again
- the value of private annotations too (for when you're irritated)
- annotations are not the same as discussion posts in an LMS

### Clearing Away The Topsoil

What is the current state of the web / internet? What things will we need to peel back?

### Web =/= Internet

**The Internet**: Physical infrastructure and protocols (TCP/IP, routers, cables, computers)

**The Web**: The application layer built on top of the internet

### The Original Vision vs. Reality

<small><small>"The original idea of the web was that it should be a collaborative space where you can communicate through sharing information." â€” Tim Berners-Lee </small></small>

<img src="images/tbl-0.gif" width=400px>
<img src="images/tbl-graphic.png" width=400px>

note:
Tim Berners-Lee's Vision (1989)
- Decentralized information sharing
- Universal access to knowledge
- User empowerment and creativity
- Open standards and protocols
- built on existing technologies like hypertext. but an emaciated vision!
AND: the web as devised by TBL wasn't the only option! Other visions on_top of the internet existed!

It occurs to me that it might be useful to explain some of the physicality of the internet (handy info here if this is all new to you: [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Howto/Web_mechanics/How_does_the_Internet_work))

The following few images are pinched from Mozilla's helpful article.

---

![](images/internet-schema-1.png)

note:
computer to computer: physically connected, functions as one big computer. A network of 2 computers

---

![](images/internet-schema-2.png)

note:
but ten computers requires 9 cables for each computer pair, so 45 cables

---

![](images/internet-schema-3.png)

note:
you invent a switch (another kind of computer), so you only need ten cables

---

![](images/internet-schema-4.png)

note:
You could start connecting these independent networks together by linking switches together, but this leads to fragility and a bunch of other engineering problems

---

![](images/internet-schema-5.png)

note:
like this

---

![](images/internet-schema-6.png)

note:
you invent a router - another kind of computer - that connects to other routers by piggybacking ontop of an existing internetwork: the phone system! So we'll also have to talk about the history of the phone, which in turn, depended on the telegraph

---

![](images/internet-schema-7.png)

note:
But how do you find the other networks? Your router connects to an ISP which handles the way-finding for you - they have super-routers connected to other super-routers. In the 1970s, an actual human being managed all of this.

Finding computers?  "IP address" (where IP stands for Internet Protocol). It's an address made of a series of four numbers separated by dots, for example: 192.0.2.172. to make things easier, we can alias an IP address with a human-readable name called a domain name. email & irc are also built on top of the internet

---

The internet exists in the physical world. Don't forget that.

note:
There's a reason why so many data centres have been built in this part of virginia, near dulles airport. We'll get to that too!

<div align="left">

#### **Today's Reality**
- Centralized corporate control
- Surveillance-based business models
- User manipulation and addiction
- Proprietary platforms dominating open standards

</div>


Note: We've moved from a web designed for collaboration to one designed for extraction and control.

### The Platform Oligopoly

</div>

note:
the big five, control most everything:
- **Google**: Search, ads, browsers, mobile OS
- **Meta**: Social networks, messaging, VR
- **Amazon**: E-commerce, cloud infrastructure, logistics
- **Apple**: Mobile ecosystem, app distribution
- **Microsoft**: Operating systems, cloud, productivity
...but keep an eye on OpenAI, Anthropic, NVidia etc...

---

<div align="left">

#### **Market Concentration Statistics**
- Google: just under 90% of global search traffic (dipping below first time in years)
- Facebook/Meta: 3+ billion active users
- Amazon: 40% of US e-commerce
- Apple/Google: pretty much all of mobile OS market share

#### The Attention Economy


<br><Br><br><br><br><br><small><small>Background photo via unsplash.com user Miikka Luotio </small></small>
</div>

note:
Persuasive Design Tactics

- Variable ratio reinforcement Tiktok for instance & how things get on FYI-> drives creators
- Fear of missing out (FOMO)
- Notification dependency

Consequences
- Average screen time: 7+ hours daily
- Shortened attention spans
- Dopamine dysregulation
- Social comparison culture

## That's the web/internet today

Next day, let's peel back some layers to start figuring out _how we got to now_.
