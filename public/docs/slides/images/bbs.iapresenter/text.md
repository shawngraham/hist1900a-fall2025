Usnet

- 'user's network' - established in 1980, uses the ability of a unix system to copy things (the 'copy' command being a fundamental function of general purpose computation) from one machine to another. Consider it a precursor to an Internet forum: you post an article to a particular topic or newsgroup. Comments can be posted underneath it, as a threaded discussion.
- this is a distributed system (hence all the copying) amongst 'news servers', or software on a machine that gathers feeds together to store and forward messages (posts & threads) to other news servers. Users simply connect to whatever news server they want. 
- technically, the newsservers are 'peered', which means that the administrators set things up to voluntarily forward whatever traffic comes their way without let or hindrance (otherwise some sort of carriage agreement would have to be in place; this does in fact happen)
- there's a protocol for this: network news transfer protocol NNTP
- it was connected to arpanet through UC Berkeley - Mary Ann Horton (grad student) would feed mailing lists from arrant onto usenet: the early internet was made of people! (Transgender person; created the first email binary attachment tool; leading proponent of usenet; eventually wrote one of the important reference books for programming in C; created some of the important infrastructure underpinning modern email as it emerges in the 90s 
- it was on usenet that Tim Berner's lee announced the web protocol (on alt.hypertext)

- a computer running software that allowed outside computers to call in.
- in effect your computer becomes a terminal for the other person's computer 
- while logged in, the user could either download information from the host server, upload new messages, 
- posts, threads, games, and porn!
- supposedly, the first was from the Chicago Area Computer Hobbyists' Exchange, development of which began when they were snowed in during the great blizzard of 1978 at the end of January 1978. Goes live in February.
- requires an acoustic coupler to turn digital data into noise on one end, and from noise back to data on the other

Fidonet
- one of the more popular computer networks of the 1980s whose backbone was a kind of BBS service. It was especially important because this is an era where long distance phone calls are one of the big cash cows for AT&T - Fidonet figured out data compression techniques that could lower the cost of connecting to BBS outside a user's local area code.
- fidonet also provided a kind of email service

- fidonet at first required hand-curated lists of telephone numbers, but eventually it develops a system of novelists; this enables fidonet nodes all over the world (Philippines gets one in 1986) and the nodes can talk to one another: this _was_ the internet for many people! And crucially is not the military/academic thing y'all are thinking of: it depends on personal computers.

From wikipedia: "The FIDONET program was what later became known as a mailer. The FIDO BBS software was modified to use a previously unused numeric field in the message headers to store a node number for the machine to which the message should be delivered to. When FIDONET ran, it would search through the email database for any messages with a number in this field. FIDONET collected all of the messages for a particular node number into a file known as a message packet. After all the packets were generated, one for each node, the FIDONET program would look up the destination node's phone number in NODELIST.BBS, and call the remote system. Provided that FIDONET was running on that system, the two systems would handshake and, if this succeeded, the calling system would upload its packet, download a return packet if there was one, and disconnect. FIDONET would then unpack the return packet, place the received messages into the local system's database, and move onto the next packet. When there were no remaining packets, FIDONET would exit, and run the FIDO BBS program" And this would be timed to happen when long-distance charges were lowest.

And with the node system: "All mail travelling between networks would first be sent to their local network host, someone who volunteered to pay for any long-distance charges. That single site would collect up all the netmail from all of the systems in their network, then re-package it into single packets destined to each network. " Again: it all depends on people! And crucially, all of it depends on a pre-existing network technology: the telephone

## Wait, we need to stop and go back a bit further

Evolution of personal computers had gotten to the point where individual consumers could own a computer, own a modem

In a way, by the 1980s, some people are acting like 'routers' themselves, dialing into one service, then dialing into another, and forwarding materials/ideas along between these services. The way Wargames depicts how the main character 'war dials' to find computers to connect to? Yup. And such numbers would be shared, sometimes digitally, sometimes physically.

# Home Brew Computer Club

homebrew computer club - 1978-19885 - menlo park, california. started by Gordon French and Fred Moore (Moore was a figure in draft resistence in the late 60s, 70s). Steve Wozniak and Stebe Jobs were members; Wozniak credits the very first meeting as where he comes up with the idea of the Apple i.

The price is a 1/3 markup on the cost to produce (current dollars, anyone?) and they originally just sold the board so that other people could build from it. Connects directly to a tv, no more terminals/teletypes/flashing lights! AND could work with almost any commercial tape recorder for saving/loading data

1977 was a big year. Apple designs & releases the Apple II, aimed at consumers; Commodore releases the PET. 'PET' doesn't originally stand for anything; just taking advantage of the fad for pet rocks and so on. Tandy TRS-80 (Tandy Radio Shack Z80). These three companies dominate the early personal computer market; they build in the BASIC programming language; they promote their machines at schools.

I have to mention the vic 20 and the commodore 64; vic 20 in 1980, c64 in 1982; my story of early hacking

Services sprang up almost immediately to allow these computers to connect to bulletin board services (more on which in a moment) and indeed directly to other computers. Modems were sold as peripherals, and software to get online could be distributed on cartridges or casettes or later floppies packaged in magazines, or through writing in to a company & providing a cheque, or....

note:
So there was a huge culture of tinkering, of fiddling around, of building things, of finding like minded individuals. it was an industry built on hobbyists. Similarly, there were people, animated by a whole raft of motivations including stick-it-to-the-man, who worked out how to mimic the sounds of digital data into phones, thus allowing them to circument AT&T's long distance charges (the basis of its $ and power). This was 'toll fraud', an offense. A wide variety of techniques were developed; some of these were just out of curiosity, wanting to know how thigns worked. Some were not. Jobs & Wozniak were part of that scene, too, helping to build the devices that phreakers used.  picture: 'blue box', a device to help phreaks phreak.

## Hence the WarGames FreakOut


/assets/Wargames.jpg
size: contain


plot: "High schooler David Lightman (played by 21-year-old Matthew Broderick) is a digitally proficient goofball who wants to play an unreleased computer game â€” and impress a pretty girl (Ally Sheedy). So he does something most Americans didn't have a word for back then: He starts hacking. Little does he know, the "computer company" he's infiltrated is actually a military installation running a missile-command supercomputer called the WOPR (War Operation Plan Response), and the game â€” Global Thermonuclear War â€” is real. Naturally, only David can stop it from setting off World War III."

it was not uncommon for people to randomly dial numbers (using techniques from phreaking, too) looking for data lines into computers. The producers actually talked to a phreak, John Draper aka 'Captain Crunch', who explained about the use of scanners looking for numbers. (Capn Crunch - toy in the cereal box emitted a tone at precisely the same frequency AT&T used to control things). Draper also happened to design a kind of modem device for the Apple II, commissioned by Wozniak, though it never got built; also designed the wordprocessor for the Apple II. 

- introduces the ideas of 'hacking' to a wide audience
- even leads to one phreak, Kevin Mitnik (arrested in 1988) getting extra solitary confinement, based on fears from the movie - or so *he* says
- more importantly: Reagan sees the film, makes his cabinet watch it; the fears this prompts find expression in updates and modifications to law. - films were all full of soviet paranoia at the time, and fear of nuclear war., congress prepares a report, and finds the movie is a 'realistic representation of access capabilities'

 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Fraud_and_Abuse_Act - previous unwarranted access framed as wire fraud or mail fraud. now makes 'unauthorized access' or 'access beyond authorization' crimes; the law continues to be expanded, folded in with patriot act post 9/11; (patriot law exemptions expired in 2020). Suffice it to say, a bit of a moral panic with concrete consequences. Remember that 'security' was never a feature of the design of the protocols for computer-to-computer transmission; that the fundamental action of the computer is to copy (goes back to Turing machine, even Babbage).

a bulletin board system was a way for a computer to answer a phone call, provide data to the other end, then hang up again. A kind of asynchronous service. Upload/download files, leave messages. Some would let you login, download all your messages/files, read & respond to them, then the next time you logged in, all your responses would be uploaded. Think a combination of reddit & early myspace. And if you don't know myspace, go look it up. By some accounts, the first BBS was by the Chicago Computer Users Club, when in 1978 a big snowstorm prevented them from meeting. One of the club's members had a modem, and he set up a basic message board on his own machine in his own apartment, allowing a 'virtual' meeting.

Fidonet - Tom Jennings (one of many queer figures in computing history) figures out a way to get BBS out of their isolation and to talk to each other. He writes a program called FIDO for IBM pc's running MS-DOS, to let people set up their own BBS. But he adds a feature to it to let one BBS call another and swap data. Fidonet is born, a store and forward type network. Initially only email being swapped, but because he made it open, people build it into other BBS services.

wargames introduces the idea of bbs to a wider audience, and numbers explore. Early commercial online services like Prodigy, America Online, and Compuserve were largely bulletin board services with a few additional bells and whistles; others like the Well (1985) whole earth 'lectronic link were more diy ish. These early and mid 80s services taught an entire generation how to 'be' online, and many of these ways-of-being can be traced back to Community Memory and Reource One. Stacy Horn, ran the extermely influential 'The Echo' out of her appartment in New York - made having women part of the governance and organization of the BBS a key part; the Echo is still online - https://www.echonyc.com/

more info: https://spectrum.ieee.org/social-medias-dialup-ancestor-the-bulletin-board-system

untangling all of these - including things like BITNET (which was a store-and-forward network that started in 1981, connecting universities in the US and Canada) - would make an excellent research project for someone. Especially BITNET - look into its Canadian dimensions

## Community Memory & Resource One - a brief 1970s flashback

/assets/gorin.png

/assets/Community-Memory-c-1974_20170207_180047.jpg

- Resource One & Project One, 1972
- hippy commune in an old warehouse, a 'pueblo in a city
- Sherry Reson, Pam Hardt-English, Mya Shone, and Chris Macie
- and somehow, they got their hands on a Scientific Data Systems 940 mainframe (in 1969 one of these was the host for SRI on arpanet)
- they were CS dropouts, joined the commune, decided they'd get it 'online'
- they introduced a computer into a culture that already was run on informal networks coordinated through physical billboards in coffee shops, music venues, on the streets.
- there were even phone lines with human operators (operating out of their own home), telephone trees, to try to help people locate their kids in the scene; also coordinated protests and rapid responses; there were 'switchboards' for all sorts of purposes all around the bay
- they wanted to use the computer to coordinate and consolidate these switchboards, for more effective action
- the 940 they got was the actual one from Stanford, which had been on lease; they convinced the actual owner it was worth more as a tax-write off to them.
- the commune wired it up, programmed it from scratch, created the 'Resource One Generalized Information Retrieval System', ROGIRS, written by Ephrem Lipkin - a way to manage this underground alternative society
- they obtain terminals&modems and place them in the coffeeshops etc but camouflaged in boxes, with 'community memory' painted on the side, make them less jarring
- signs like 'where can i get a decent bagel in the bay area / if you know leave the information here in the computer'
- people start leaving all sorts of things, even having conversations
- the switchboard part kinda failed, but the community part thrived; to fill in the gap left by the switchboard, they create a.social service referral dtabase that actual social workers used; the resource one people would call around and would update the information themselves in the machine, keep track of everything & then they *printed the thing out and mailed it to social workers* .  three ring binder, but still a networked object.
- the United Way eventually takes over the directory (which was still a going concern up to 2009)
- they make decisions based on consensus
- a model for how to *be* online, and for what *ordinary* folks might want to use the machines for

This is Stacy Horn

Stacy Horn, The Echo

*anyone* could set up a BBS. And so BBS's became these amazing carnivals of different people, united by shared interests. Every BBS had its own social norms, expectations. It kinda reminds me of picking a server to join for Fediverse type software (aka mastodon). It was personal, intimate. A place of connection. And because of telephone bills, it required a certain creativity to work around the limitations this imposed.  Stacy Horn for instance wanted an 'east coast hang out' alternative to the Whole Earth 'Electronic Link or WELL, which was started up by the same people who'd created the Whole Earth Catalog, a counterculture magazine of the '60s. You get the vibe happening online? Very different place. No one would fund her, so she did it with $20000 on her credit card. For Horn, she got so much traffic that the new york phone company had to lay a dedicated data line down her street. She eventually charged $10  a month + $4/hr ; only ever had a few thousand members, but they were all figures in the culture and arts scene in New York, so this had an outsized impact on 90s web culture. Still online today.

So to sum things up a bit:
- Exploiting tone-based phone switching systems
- Blue boxes, red boxes, other "colored box" devices
- Free long-distance calls = free access to distant BBS
- **The phone system was the first "network" to be hacked**

The Phreaker Mindset

- Understanding how systems *really* work
- Exploring boundaries of technology
- Community of knowledge sharing
- **"If it uses tones, we can manipulate it"**

- Phone phreaks often became early computer enthusiasts
- Skills transferred: system exploration, boundary testing
- BBS culture inherited phreaker ethics of information sharing
- Both communities valued technical knowledge and system access

BBS Culture and Communities
- Local meetups and user groups
- SysOps (System Operators) as community leaders
- Message bases organized by topic
- File libraries for software sharing
- Door games and online entertainment

The Modem: Gateway Between Worlds
- 300 baud â†’ 1200 baud â†’ 2400 baud â†’ 9600 baud
- Acoustic couplers giving way to direct-connect modems
- Hayes command set becomes standard
- **The sound of the handshake**

BBS Networks: Trying to Scale

- **FidoNet**: Store-and-forward message passing
- Long-distance calls made during off-peak hours
- Messages would "hop" from BBS to BBS
- Creating a poor man's internet before the Internet

---

	The plot so far:
	- the emergence of BBS and other online services that are *not* the internet 
	- the emergence of personal computers
	- piggybacking on existing communications tech 
		- Remember, the other kind of 'computer' most people would be familiar with would be the Atari video game console (and similar)
		- playing games -> desire to connect -> WarGames -> regulatory climate
		- playing games -> technological innovation

driven by hobbyists looking to tinker and people looking to find community (and in some cases, by gov'ts.)
- and games. Lots and lots of games!

## A Brief Digression On Video Games
	(more next time)
	[Play Spacewar! here](https://www.masswerk.at/spacewar/)

/assets/dec-pdp1-computer.jpg


note:
1977 prototype for the atari video computer system; atari graveyard; spacewar 1962; gendering of video games after the 1983 crash, when toy companies end up buying/taking over . The video game cartridge was invented by engineer Jerry Lawson, for a console called the Fairchild F in 1976; commercial flop, but cartridges become THE way for games to be distributed. Lawson was also a member of the homebrew computer company, once interviewed Wozniak for a job at Fairchild. Goes on to write games for Atari. And games beget magazines, and BBS looking for people to swap games, hints, tips, talk strategy, etc.

(Incidentally spacewar, 1962, MIT considered to be one of if not the first video games, for use on the PDP-1 computer. In the 1960s these were used to develop what were in effect the first routers or interfaces between a mainframe, another router, and another mainframe. Also timesharing developed on these. 4k memory "US$ 120,000 and another US$ 14,300 for the display, which translated to 13 average family homes and a brand new car in 1960. But, compared to other computers, this was actually cheap.")

- these early communities give people a sense of how to *be* , via a computer
- because a lot of the early games were about recreating a sense of an actual place, my contention: these actually *were* places, for all intents and purposes.
- they were someplace you *went.* Your body might be here, but your mind & social world were elsewhere.

## Creeper / Reaper

	>I'M THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN

note:
BBN: Bolt, Beranek and Newman, Inc - who we'll meet again int the 1970s - company that makes specialized computers that allow networking

Creeper - designed by Bob Thomas at BBN; it would copy itself onto connected computers. the first worm. 1971. 'I'M THE CREEPER CATCH ME IF YOU CAN'

Reaper - designed by Ray Tomlison, to seek out and eliminate Creeper. 1972

virus: requires a host program to move around; it executes itself before the host program does what it is supposed to do. worm: self sufficient program on its own. Creeper wasn't malicious - it was mostly a 'I wonder if this will work'. It would copy itself to a new machine, and delete itself on the old machine if it could.
Alan Davis, grad student at UIUC, devises a process for a PDP-11 computer. it would see if a copy of itself was running; if not, it would make a copy and start it; then it would see if disk space was available; if so, it'd make a file that would fill that space, then start the process over again. If someone tried to save work, there'd be no space; if they deleted something, the space would automatically fill up again. Yeah, this one is malicious. A similar virus called 'Rabbit' spreads the following year. I do not know who is behind that one.
- some of these things spread because *people* share the host software - they ftp it to a new system, or later, it's on a floppy disc.
- some of these things spread because they actively are looking for a connection

- made software for the Apple IIe for heart monitoring
- which was being pirated. They devised this virus to track and stop illegal copying. The message displayed gave the full contact details for the brothers, who if you paid them for the software would then remove the virus. Ransomware? Not quite - was meant to stop piracy of their IP. Someone ported the way the virus worked from the Apple to IBM (but kept the 'vaccination' message). 
- a lot of software is distributed over BBS as shareware, pay-as-you-can, or freeware; lots of copying going on

## The Morris Worm - 1988

1988 - Remember, by this time, the internet *is* a thing, accessed through a variety of text-based programs, and becoming commercially important
- November 2, 1988, 8.30 pm, a program starts spreading; emerges first at MIT
- Grinds computer to a halt. Multiple infection vecotrs- exploits loopholes in the code ('backdoors') in email systems, exploits the 'FINGER' command (for finding out who is online on a given machine or system, icky word), and other routes. Designed to hide. Targets a particular flavour of the widespread UNIX operating system
- military systems, university systems slow to a crawl. emails delayed for day. no files destroyed, but massively disruptive, and expensive.

- the programmer who created it had released it in error; he contacted friends almost immediately asking them to post anonymous messages around the web about how to delete the worm; but by this time it was too late and people didn't really spot the messages
- one of the friends made a call to the New York Times (anonymously) with the warning, saying it was meant as a harmless experiment; the friend referred to the programmer by his initials, which enabled the reported to track the programmer down as Robert Tappan Morris at Cornell U. 23 years old.
- FBI arrests him under our old friend the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act - found guilty in 1989, fined, probabition, 400 hrs community service.
- This is the episode that *really* begins to prompt cybersecurity work, vis-a-vis the internet

# So... The Internet of the 1980s
Image is 56 kbps 'backbone' for nsfnet 1986; number of networks grows from 2000 to 30 000 by 1986


- There's ARPANet
- There's MILNET
- There's computer science research network: 1979, CSNET; its researchers use a protocol called TCP/IP for connecting their compuers up. This eventually becomes NSFNet has better funding & finance and it's this network that initially prohibits commercial use but through fidget and any number of hacked together kludges, things are joining together; This becomes the backbone of the version of the 'internet' that enters public consciousness in the 1990s, deregulated thanks to senator Al Gore's various bills
- There are competing protocols in the 1980s for how computers should connect to the 'backbones'; DARPA mandates that everyone should stop using the Network Control Protocol (ARPAnet's rules) to the TCP/IP protocol.
- There are individual company networks
- There's weird stuff going on in other countries (our story is primarily an American one, alas)
- They all use different protocols
- Weird stuff is happening

By 1979, only 16 arpanet notes were academic; the 46 remaining were military; 1983 those military ones spun off into MILNET; ARPANET shut down in 1989. So, while a lot of the technical problems for how networks and computers might communicate were first articulated and solved in ARPANET (remember, the story is more complicated than that), other protocols, other groups, other networks, and other ways of doing data communication have emerged.

Indeed, a number of CS departments in the states NOT on ARPANet managed to convince the NSF in 1981 to pony up cash for a leaner network, the CSNET (computer science research network). It offered different tiers of connectivity - just email, for instance- and soon had more than 70 sites by 1983; used TCP/IP; unlike arpanet, the finances of this arrangement worked better, and the NSF agreed to build a 'backbone' connecting up the supercomputing centres that *it* funded. 1986. This was the NSFNET and it was a super high speed connection The NSF also agreed to allow commercial access to NSFNET in 1

You can see that this is where the manly men of CS were working hard in the 1980s, while the multimedia work of hypertext was coded female/lesser.
