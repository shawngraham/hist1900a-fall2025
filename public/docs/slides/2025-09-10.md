+ C: technological features have social, economic, and cultural implications
+ D: yes to all of that

### Everything is Awful

<img src="/images/this-is-fine-meme-3607530144.jpg" class="r-stretch">

Everything's been... enshittified.

The last fifteen years or so have been particularly bad (and getting worse?)

<div align="left">

"Here is how platforms die: first, they are good to their users; then they abuse their users to make things better for their business customers; finally, they abuse those business customers to claw back all the value for themselves. Then, they die."

**â€” [Cory Doctorow](https://pluralistic.net/), 2023**

### enshittification (noun)

A systematic process where digital platforms progressively degrade their service quality to extract maximum value.

</div>

note: 
Doctorow coined this term in 2023, https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/ though the pattern has been observable for years across major platforms. Most people forget that last part though. Doctorow's concept gives us a framework for understanding platform decay and points toward structural solutions rather than just individual responses.

## The Three-Stage Process

### Stage 1: **User Acquisition**
<img src="images/strawberry1.png" class="r-stretch">

note:
- Platforms prioritize user experience
- Services are free or cheap
- Focus on growth and engagement

---

### Stage 2: **Business Customer Focus**

<img src="images/strawberry2.png" class="r-stretch">

note:
- Users become the product
- Advertisers and business partners prioritized
- User experience begins to degrade

---

### Stage 3: **Value Extraction**

<img src="images/strawberry3.png" class="r-stretch">

note:
- Platform squeezes all parties
- Maximizes profit extraction
- Quality deteriorates rapidly

Each stage represents a fundamental shift in who the platform serves and how value flows through the system.

<div align="left">

With regard to AI, what stage are we at?
</div>

note:
AI is a web technology that has profound implications for how the internet will work in the future (data centres, mining, centralization of power, control)

---

<div align="left">

Enshittification was understood from the beginning - Page & Brin in 1998:

"Advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of consumers"

</div>

note:
- the greatest thing that the internet did was 'the end-to-end principle'. Doctorow: "he end-to-end principle: the idea that networks should be designed so that willing speakers' messages would be delivered to willing listeners' end-points as quickly and reliably as they could be. That is, irrespective of whether a network operator could make money by sending you the data it wanted to receive, its duty would be to provide you with the data you wanted to see."

- But advertising, and the walled gardens that emerged over the last twenty years, make it too easy to trap people in. Each platform starts by giving things away, and then they make it too hard to leave; then they give you away to business, and make it too hard for them to leave; then they just extract funds until the carcass dies.


---

## Why Does This Happen?

---

### Network Effect

<img src="images/network-effect.png" class="r-stretch">

note:

- utility grows as more people join
- Users can't easily leave due to social connections: you can't take your graph with you!
- "Everyone else is here" mentality
- High switching costs

---

### **Switching Costs**

<img src="images/switching_costs.png" class="r-stretch">

note:
- Data lock-in (photos, messages, connections)
- Learning new interfaces
- Loss of digital identity/history

---

### **Market Consolidation**

<img src="images/borg.jpg" class="r-stretch">

note:
- Few viable alternatives
- Acquisition of competitors
- Regulatory capture

These factors create a "walled garden" where users become trapped, allowing platforms to gradually extract more value.

---

## Classic Example: Facebook's Evolution

---

### **2004-2012: User Paradise**

- Clean, chronological timeline
- No ads, organic reach
- Privacy-focused messaging

---

### **2013-2019: Advertiser Heaven**
- Algorithm-driven feeds
- Promoted posts and ads
- Data harvesting for targeting

---

### **2020-Present: Value Extraction**
- Pay-to-reach your own audience
- Aggressive data collection
- Declining organic reach for creators

note: 
Facebook's transformation perfectly illustrates the three-stage enshittification process over nearly two decades.

- never even minding that Z's first site was created as a way of creeping on women students; 'FaceMash' - hot or not; zuckerberg invaded privacy, violated copyright, breach of security... but hey, let's prosecute aaron swartz, eh? (Z also tried to use early login data for thefacebook to breach the security of Harvard Crimson student reporters) ... So that's the kind of guy Z is.
- early FB showed you posts from friends and family; they join so they can see your posts; now you can't leave because swtiching costs are too high - you can't take your graph with you
- then it starts shoving posts into your feed from accounts you don't follow - started with media companies - sending lots of eyeballs to those companies
- then it chocked off the ability for media company to post an excerpt, had to post the full text
- now the readers don't go to the publications, so they're completely dependent on FB. Would not show articles to the readers who explicitly signed up to follow those publications unless they paid FB a ransom to boost their articles.
- it does the same thing to sellers. Comes to an illegal agreement with Google where FB would get an illegal advantage in advertising auctions in exchange for FB canning its own service.
- (oh, and by the way, fb has run unethical behavioural experiments to see if they can manipulate people's emotions. They can.)

## The Amazon Marketplace Pattern

---

### **Early Days (2000s)**
- Best prices for consumers
- Easy returns and shipping
- Focus on customer satisfaction

---

### **Growth Phase (2010s)**
- Sellers flocked to the platform
- Amazon optimized for seller fees
- Introduction of sponsored products

---

### **Current State**
- Search results dominated by ads
- Counterfeit products proliferate
- Sellers squeezed by fees and competition

note: 
Amazon shows how enshittification affects e-commerce, with fake reviews and sponsored results making genuine product discovery increasingly difficult. Amazon says if you sell anywhere else, the price on amazon has to be the lowest

---

## The Decline of Google Search 

---

### **The Golden Age**
- Relevant, useful results
- Minimal advertising
- Focus on information quality

---

### **The Ad Revolution**
- Sponsored results at top
- SEO gaming becomes profitable
- Content farms proliferate

---

### **Today's Reality**
- First page dominated by ads and AI-generated content
- Genuine expertise buried
- User intent secondary to ad revenue

note: 
Google's search quality has notably declined as advertising revenue has taken priority over user experience.

## Why Traditional Antitrust Fails

<img src="images/antitrust.jpeg" class="r-stretch">

note:

**The Competition Myth**
- "Users can switch" ignores network effects
- High barriers to entry for competitors
- Data advantages compound over time

**The Innovation Excuse**
- Platforms claim features require scale
- Argue against "stifling innovation"
- Regulatory capture through lobbying

**The Free Service Defense**
- "It's free, so what's the harm?"
- Ignores attention and data as payment
- Externalizes social and democratic costs

Current antitrust law struggles with platform economics because it focuses on prices rather than quality degradation. Anti-trust laws re-interpreted from promoting competition to saying 'hey the most efficient actor in the market is a big one and so we'll allow mergers'

## Real-World Consequences

![](images/poop.jpg)

note:
**Democratic Impacts**
- Information manipulation and filter bubbles
- Undermining of shared truth
- Platform control over political discourse

**Economic Effects**
- Small business dependence on platform access
- Creator economy exploitation
- Innovation stifling through acquisition

**Social Costs**
- Mental health impacts from engagement optimization
- Privacy erosion
- Digital divide and platform dependency

Enshittification isn't just about inconvenience - it has profound societal implications across democratic, economic, and social domains.

solutions?

Solutions require both systemic change and individual awareness. The key is reducing platform power through competition and regulation.

### **Regulatory Approaches**
- **Interoperability mandates** - force platforms to work with competitors
- **Data portability rights** - let users take their data elsewhere
- **Algorithmic transparency** - require disclosure of ranking systems

### **Technical Solutions**
- **Decentralized platforms** - distribute power across networks
- **Open protocols** - create platform-independent standards
- **User-owned alternatives** - cooperative and non-profit models

### **Individual Actions**
- Diversify platform usage
- Support alternative platforms
- Advocate for regulatory change

- Enshittification is **inevitable** under current conditions
- **User lock-in** is the fundamental enabler
- **Competition policy** must evolve for the digital age

bummer, eh?
