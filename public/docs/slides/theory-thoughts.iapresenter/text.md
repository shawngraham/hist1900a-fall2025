## which is to say, let's talk about how we turn 'facts' into 'history'

---

## history => ἱστορία
	From ῐ̔στορέω (hĭstoréō, “to inquire”) +‎ -ῐ́ᾱ (-ĭ́ā), from ἵστωρ (hístōr, “one who knows, wise one”). 

	ῐ̔στορῐ́ᾱ • (hĭstorĭ́ā) f (genitive ῐ̔στορῐ́ᾱς); first declension
	inquiry, examination, systematic observation, science
	body of knowledge obtained by systematic inquiry
	written account of such inquiries, narrative, history
	

## 'Do Your Own Research' is not the same as having actual training
	The first is about half-assed searching & falling prey to confirmation bias
	The second is always asking 'how am I wrong / what am I missing / triangulation

## My Theoretical Perspective
	ie, what body of ideas do I draw on when I try to make sense of the unfamiliar?

All hands: what's your take on how I think? What are _my_ guiding principles? 

Archaeology explores what it means to be human, through its material traces. It's not just 'old' things, though that's where we started, in archaeology. If we think of the internet as 'material', what do we pay attention to?

	[τέχνη](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%CF%84%CE%AD%CF%87%CE%BD%CE%B7#English "wikt:τέχνη")
	'craft', 'art', 
	proto indo-european "Teks-" meaning "to weave," also "to fabricate"
	also implies _episteme_, or a system of knowledge, of practical things

note: 'digital' pertains to the digits, fingers and toes, and counting under ten; the sense of discrete numbers and computation from that is a 20th century develop of the term, as opposed to 'analog' systems where the value is continuous.

Just a few items to remind you of some of the *physicality* of our current computational moment, the physicality of its past; here memory storage. Note in the picture of the workers using the Jacquard Loom - who's doing the work? Ditto, Core Rope Memory

	We need archaeology not just because of the *things* of this history we want to explore, but also because of the *places* of this history!

# The point 

	The history of the net has *many* different aspects, how can _you_ bring order to this?

	This is what 'theory' is for. Theory is a framework for understanding the world & directing your attention.

	Theory tells you which bits are important. Theory helps frame your questions.
	But there are many different theories to order our observations.

note:
I'm going to do a whistle stop tour through a variety of archaeological/historical theories to highlight various elements of the archaeological theories that inform my scholarship, so that you understand what the questions are that inform our class. (and 'whistlestop' is a metaphor from an earlier era of networked communication! today's version might be crossposting the same message across social media)

## Questions From A Worker Who Reads

	[Click to read poem here](https://allpoetry.com/Questions-From-A-Worker-Who-Reads)
	Bertolt Brecht

note:
This is a theoretical position. What would it direct our attention to, in the context of the history of the internet?

## Space/Economy

![[Atlantic_cable_Map.jpg]]

	"2 Weeks to 2 Minutes"
	See also [Roman Empire](https://orbis.stanford.edu/) 

note:
Space economy refers to the way investments in infrastructure contract the experience of space between places. Ray Laurence makes a persuasive case for how the creation of all-weather roads in the Roman republic turned Italy into a cohesive unit, thus setting the stage for later expansion. But infrastructure has very long term effects: https://web.econ.ku.dk/pabloselaya/papers/RomanRoads.pdf thus when we think of the internet as a 'place' it also means that the places with which it intersects are going to be impacted long term. When things become 'networked' - and a network exists whenever there is a relationship between two or more *things* - that brings us into Complexity theory and thinking about the effects of what flows over networks.

---

## Complicated vs Complex
	A rocket ship versus the Queensway
	+ difference between complicated & complex;
	+ idea of emergence
	+ particular network shapes enable emergence
	+ feedback is a big part of this

note:
I'm building up a picture here. We've got individuals enmeshed in systems that collapse time and space, and these systems have real-world effects. Complex systems are useful for considering what happens when you've got many different kinds of things interacting in non-linear ways - like the Queensway. The things we study are often *emergent* from lower level elements.

---

## Assemblage Theory 

	*agencement*, things come together
	- meaning depends on context
	- both internal, within
	- external, in time
	- external, in space
	- nothing is meaningful on its own

note:
see gavin lucas p71

old germanic word 'thing' means an assembly or gathering

how does a thing gather unto itself? human agency isn't what matters but the force of agency, or 'how actions are distributed across a network or assemblage composed of both humans and non-humans'.

a jug is not purely a human creation. form depends on an assembly: 'a coming-together of clay, a fast wheel, a kiln, a skilled potter...'

---
	[potter video](https://youtu.be/9c30nN1rp8g)
	- there are no captions on this video
	- Just watch how the clay responds to the potter's intuition
	- you can't divide the world into physical objects/properties and human agency; 
	- it's the interaction between human and object that matters, the space in-between
	- This is sometimes called 'material engagement theory'

note:
see gavin lucas 'archaeological situations' 71-73
labos malafouris takes example of pottery making a pot. They can't tell you or explain exactly what they're doing. The pot that emerges is driven by an idea in their mind, but it reacts to the realities of the clay, the wheel, the water, previous pots made, ambitions for future pots. (same is true of code!)  p73 material agency argues' That mental acts do not just occur in our heads, or even in our hands and fingers, but extend outward into the things around us' - parallels with extended cognition - but for malafouris the agency of the objects super important

---

## Perspectivism
	- the way we record information **matters** 
	- we try to mirror 'natural breakages', but there are many ways to make the decisions
	- these categories *emerge* from our engagement with the material
	- like with the potter and the wheel; if we don't think the relationship with the clay matters, you don't even look to see it

---

## So, if we pull that altogether...?
	Well, here's what *I* think...

---

	- a network is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows. (_argh! we'll need a definition of information!_)
	- networks form a substrate for social life, and humans aren't the only things that can have a social life
	- networks leave physical traces

---

	- more complex phenomena can emerge from interactions in certain network shapes
	- networks also provide a formal mechanism through which computation can happen - computation is inherent in the shape of the network
	- the components of a networked history are not just the technical objects, but also the assemblage

note:
people have 3d printed neural network architectures that have been trained on images. show an image to the network, and the pattern of light through it itself will result in a classification!

---

	- material agencies extend cognition into our things 
	- meaning is relational

---

## Now What do *YOU* Think?

	- take a few moments to jot down the parts that are maybe confusing
	- talk it out with your neighbours 
	- does any of this resonate with any of your own _observations_ as recorded in your _memos_?

---

	To my mind, all of this implies the following questions we might ask as we *inquire* into the internet
	 - what are the social/political/economic contexts of the people, places, things?
	- what are the assemblages that make this *thing* up?
	- how do those assemblages extend in time or space?

---

	- how do networks intersect (which is distinct from interconnect)?
	- what drives network evolution? who/what are key players? 
	- how do we study such things?

---

## ok, here's a question. Semaphore networks worked, and worked quickly. So why did the electrical telegraph win out?

- we've seen how lots of techs exist as *assemblages*
- assemblages can be thought of as *complex systems*
- in the right conditions, complex systems can *evolve*

But what are the right conditions? Why did the electrical telegraph win out? So, let's look at this from a *theoretical* point of view

---
	For that, we need a framework that helps us identify the *why* of the story.
	History is a *verb*, an inquiry; we inquire to understand *why*

We'll follow the work of a historian of science named Brian Winston here. This isn't to say this is the best framework, or the only framework; it just happens to *be* a framework that helps direct our attention to certain common patterns. Remember, different theories cause us to pay attention to different elements and the way they interrelate. History isn't the past; history is a tool for *making sense* of the past in the **present**. 
- One thing you might make a note of is to look Brian Winston up, look up reviews of his work. This is the work of *historiography* and is just as necessary to doing history as all the other bits.

# DON'T STRESS ABOUT THESE NEXT SLIDES

You will see that I have in fact been using a modified version of all this throughout the course.

---

![[model1.png]]

Winston has a theory about how technology emerges. He says that ultimately, new technologies emerge and become transformational only when certain things happen in the social sphere.

---

![[model2.png]]

For something to move from 'science' to 'technology' and thence 'to the future', there are a series of transformations that have to happen socially. You have to have **scientific competency** first, and an idea; notice that 'scientific competency' ALSO exists in the social sphere. That's why lots of people have similar ideas at the same time.

---

![[model3.png]]

When people have similar ideas at similar times, **prototype** technologies emerge. IE, the difference engine.

---

![[model4.png]]

But whether or not a prototype becomes something else depends on whether there is what Winston calls 'a supervening social necessity' in that social sphere. 

---

![[model5.png]]

If there is, a prototype becomes what we might recognize as 'an invention' - and remember how some individuals are recognized as 'the inventor' while others who've made similar prototypes are not: it's not just that there's a supervening social necessity, but that it happens at a specific moment, place, and social context (ie relationships). It's a coming-together; agencement.

---

![[model6.png]]

Things tart to get wacky at this point. This is Winston's answer to why some inventions take off and others don't: like the civil servant who worked to shut down Turing's ACE work.
---

![[model7.png]]

But once something is invented, it can diffuse and prompt another whole round of competence & ideation as we move into the future.

---
	So the digital computer: 
	+ What are some of the 'competences' required for it?
	+ Supervening Social Necessities?
	+ Suppression of Radical Potential?

## Winston's approach is only one. But this kind of structured approach to your thought helps you identify what *matters* to your story, to your *inquiry*
