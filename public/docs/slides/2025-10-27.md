### Reminder

<small>

- some readings are better suited to a précis, some are better suited to THOMAS
- précis:
	+ _In Chapter 1 of One Dimensional Man (1964), author_A argues that […]. To build this argument, author_A […]. Author_A makes this argument in order to […]._
- THOMAS: 
	+ citation key, Topic, Historiography, Oranization, Method, Argument, So What?
- Memo: 
	+ This part explains what you found significant, connects the lectures to the reading, explains why the reading matters, and how it connects with what you're reading elsewhere in this class or outside of class, etc.
