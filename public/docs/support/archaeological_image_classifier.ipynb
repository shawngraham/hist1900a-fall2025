        "We're going to build an archaeological image classifier using Tensorflow, a library of python packages designed to perform machine learning tasks. We are going to train a model to recognize different kinds of Roman pottery. (We are following a modified version of the [Tensorflow for poets](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/tensorflow-for-poets/#0) tutorial, using slightly older versions of Tensorflow, but a version that I know _works_).\n",
        "\n",
        "The data we're going to use comes from [Potsherd: Atlas of Roman Pottery](http://potsherd.net/atlas/potsherd). I've already downloaded the dataset, using a bit of python (as described [here](https://bonetrade.github.io/tutorials/tensorflow-for-poets/)). The zip file with those images is available in the course data directory. It's not the full database; rather, I just put together a small set of ten or so different types of pottery, just to keep things manageable. \n",
        "\n",
        "Download the zip file, and then upload it to your google drive account. (If you go to https://drive.google.com, you can click the big `+ New`, select `upload file`.)\n",

        "Click on `edit` -> `notebook settings` and change `hardware accelerator` to `GPU`. Then click `save`. Machine learning is extremely heavy in the sense that it requires a lot of computational resources. Running the calculations on a GPU rather than a CPU (your normal processor) can speed up the work significantly. And of course, some code explicitly requires a GPU rather than a CPU."

Tech-wise, the biggest issue is that we're training on a dataset that is just _too small_. For this to _really_ work well enough to the point where we might actually want to use it, we'd need thousands of images.
