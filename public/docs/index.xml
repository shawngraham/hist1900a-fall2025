      <description>At the end of the course, as a final exam, you will write an &amp;rsquo;exit ticket&amp;rsquo;. The Exit Ticket will consist of a single question that you respond to; you will make explicit reference to the various readings (which you have already created précis notes for) in order to craft your response. I will release that question to you by week 12.&#xA;The second part of the Exit Ticket is where you evaluate your development as a student in this course according to the explicit learning outcomes.</description>

      <description>Some of our in-class work will be devoted to crafting research memos that use the rhetorical précis as formulated by the historian Chad Black.&#xA;courtesy of [Chad Black](https://chadblack.net/2023SPORT/resources/how%20to%20write%20a%20precis%20and%20memo/, quoted in full below with a few small friendly amendments&#xA;The Rhetorical Précis is a formula designed to help you move beyond simple summary to a more analytical synopsis of a work. As such, the précis, in a compact form, forces you to think about both the content and method of a piece of scholarship.</description>

      <description>Reading an academic article is not like &amp;lsquo;regular&amp;rsquo; reading. You don&amp;rsquo;t start at the beginning and wait for the big reveal at the end. (You don&amp;rsquo;t write like that either.)&#xA;Read Like A Predator Read like a predator. You&amp;rsquo;re after something. Each time your read the paper, you&amp;rsquo;re after something different.&#xA;First time: just the abstract, maybe the intro Second time: intro, conclusion Third time: discussion, conclusion Fourth time: methods What you&amp;rsquo;re doing is a kind of triage.</description>

      <description>Reading Historical Scholarship¶ Reading historical scholarship is not just about understanding the content, but also figuring out how the thing you&amp;rsquo;re reading is part of a broader dialogue. Allow me to introduce a useful approach to reading such material by Danna Agmon called &amp;lsquo;THOMAS&amp;rsquo;. I quote Agmon directly below:&#xA;THOMAS: A Useful Mnemonic for Reading Historical Scholarship&#xA;When reading works of historical scholarship, the following mnemonic is a helpful tool to keep in mind as you prepare for class.</description>

      <description>Entrance Tickets These are ungraded responses to prompts that I will use to kick-off discussions. On days with an &amp;rsquo;entrance ticket&amp;rsquo;, you will have jotted a quick response on a notecard before class (and you&amp;rsquo;ll have printed your name on it too). I will collect these at the start of class. Their completion however will count towards your &amp;lsquo;academic presence&amp;rsquo;.&#xA;In-class exercises Periodically, we will do some in-class writing where you draw on the most recent assigned readings and lectures.</description>

There are two interconnected components to this course.&#xA;This website: it is the overarching context for what I am trying to teach you re digital archaeology.

COPIES OF WRITTEN WORK SUBMITTED Always retain for yourself a copy of all essays, term papers, written assignments or take-home tests submitted in your courses.&#xA;PLAGIARISM The University Senate defines plagiarism as “presenting, whether intentionally or not, the ideas, expression of ideas or work of others as one’s own.” This can include:</description>

      <description>The Most Important Idea The internet is an emergent thing at the intersection of power, energy, information, materials, and humans. Always: humans. An archaeological perspective on this pays attention to entanglements and flows. And if we apply the appropriate lenses to how we look, we might begin to understand why and how.&#xA;Spend some time with Kate Crawford&amp;rsquo;s Calculating Empires to see what I mean (you&amp;rsquo;ll want to open this in a new browser window; try taking the audio tour, too).</description>

      <description>Questions Here are some theses.&#xA;Meaning depends on context. Nothing exists on its own. In the process of becoming, we respond to the materials we work with, and they respond to us. Therefore, networks (of all kinds) are fundamental to how we live in the world. A network is present whenever there is a relationship between two entities along which information flows. Network shapes and flow give rise to emergent structures.</description>

      <description>In this final module, you will try to find the compelling story and to communicate it, in various ways, to your intended public. To whom does archaeology belong? Does it matter how we tell the story?&#xA;Each week, you have tasks, readings, and or things to listen to/watch that I would like you to complete. These should be done -or at least attempted- before moving onto the next week.</description>

      <description>The ‘history of the internet’ is more than the history of a particular package of technologies. It’s a story about power, people, culture, and materials. The ‘internet’ isn’t a thing, it’s a place and since time and space are unified, it’s an age. What is an appropriate frame to study the internet, and once we’ve decided on that, what might we see? I’m not sure where this will take us – but wherever we go, the journey will change how you think about the world.</description>

      <description>According to section 2 of FASS Undergraduate Teaching Regulations and Procedures, this course outline constitutes a contract between you the student, and me, the professor. However, the word ‘syllabus’ (aka, the course outline), it seems is based on a misreading of a misprint of the Greek word ‘sittybis’, meaning a table of contents. A table of contents is not a contract. Nevertheless, let us have a contract thus:&#xA;I, Professor Graham, agree to undertake to the best of my abilities, the task of challenging, guiding, and fostering in you, a deeper appreciation, awareness, and understanding for the ideas discussed in this class.</description>

      <description>Goals Do Report Back A Choice Goals for this week Pick the most impressive thing you&amp;rsquo;ve done so far in this course (any week) and do it over but explain what&amp;rsquo;s different this time. Reflect on the different between reproducing something and replicating something. How is &amp;lsquo;replication&amp;rsquo; a critical feature of digital archaeology, and how does that tie into the different audiences we write for? How has your thinking evolved since the end of Module 2?</description>

      <description>Goals Listen Read Do Reflect Report Back In the podcast episode, I talk about what it is I find &amp;rsquo;enchanting&amp;rsquo; about digital archaeology. A lot of that concerns the idea of &amp;rsquo;emergence&amp;rsquo;, that if things are connected together like this then interesting unpredictable things might emerge at a higher level of complexity. Therefore, we&amp;rsquo;ll spend time with networks: first to represent archaeological data, and then as a substrate for computing archaeological data.</description>

      <description>Goals Listen Read Do Reflect Report Back This week represents a kind of pivot point in the course. So far, we&amp;rsquo;ve largely been focused on the moment when observations in the field become data, and then on the kinds of manipulations of those data we might do. This week, we&amp;rsquo;re going to zoom out a bit and consider how we get from that level of detail to larger scale macroscopic stories about the past.</description>
